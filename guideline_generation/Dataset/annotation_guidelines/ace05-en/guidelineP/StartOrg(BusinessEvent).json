            "Key characteristics of the StartOrg event include the presence of an agent (the entity or entities responsible for the creation), the organization being created, and the place where the organization is being established.",
            "The scope of the StartOrg event encompasses various domains such as business, government, non-profits, and other organizational forms. It is not limited to commercial enterprises.",
