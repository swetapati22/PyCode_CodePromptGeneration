        "description": [
            "The Transport event involves the movement of entities (people, objects, etc.) from one location to another. This event is characterized by the presence of a source (origin) and a target (destination).",
            "Transport events can be triggered by verbs such as 'transport', 'move', 'deploy', 'cross', and 'return'. These events often involve an agent facilitating the movement and a vehicle used for transportation.",
            "Key characteristics of Transport events include the identification of the entities being moved (artifacts or victims), the locations involved (origin and destination), and the means of transport (vehicle).",
            "The scope of Transport events can vary from small-scale movements (e.g., a person traveling) to large-scale operations (e.g., mass evacuations or troop deployments).",
            "Transport events are a subset of MovementEvents, specifically focusing on the logistics and mechanisms of moving entities from one place to another."

        "origin": [
            "The origin is the starting point of the transport event, indicating where the movement begins. For example, in 'trains running to and from southern Sudan', 'southern Sudan' is the origin.",
            "The origin can be a specific location, such as a city, country, or any identifiable place. For instance, 'Malaysia' in 'cross the border between Malaysia and Singapore'.",
            "In some cases, the origin might be implied or contextually understood rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'deploying some of Iraq's exiles' implies the origin is Iraq.",
            "The origin is crucial for understanding the full context of the transport event, as it provides the starting point of the movement.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the origin is a general area or region rather than a specific point, such as 'the country' in 'deploying around the country'."

        "victim": [
            "The victim refers to individuals who are being moved involuntarily or under duress. For example, 'abducted women and children' in 'used to transport abducted women and children'.",
            "Victims are typically people who are affected negatively by the transport event, such as refugees or kidnapped individuals.",
            "In some contexts, the term 'victim' might be used metaphorically or broadly to include anyone adversely affected by the transport event.",
            "The identification of victims is important for understanding the humanitarian or ethical implications of the transport event.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the victim is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'who' in 'Mr. Chalabi, who was assisted by U.S. forces'."

        "vehicle": [
            "The vehicle is the means of transport used in the event, such as 'trains' in 'trains running to and from southern Sudan'.",
            "Vehicles can include any mode of transportation, such as cars, planes, ships, or even animals in some contexts.",
            "The vehicle provides insight into the logistics and scale of the transport event, indicating how the movement is facilitated.",
            "In some cases, the vehicle might be implied or contextually understood rather than explicitly stated.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the vehicle is a non-traditional mode of transport, such as 'deploying' which implies the use of military vehicles or equipment."

            "The time refers to when the transport event occurs, providing temporal context. For example, 'In last year's trial' indicates the time frame of the event.",

            "The time helps in understanding the sequence and duration of the transport event.",
            "In some cases, the time might be implied or contextually understood rather than explicitly stated.",

            "The identification of artifacts is crucial for understanding what is being moved and the purpose of the transport event.",
