        "description": "An 'Appeal' event in the context of justice refers to a formal request made to a higher court to review and potentially change the decision of a lower court. This event involves a higher judicial authority and follows a prior judgment, focusing on the process of challenging that outcome. Unlike 'Convict' or 'Sentence' events, which deal with the trial's outcome, an 'Appeal' event specifically involves seeking a review of a decision. The outcome can include upholding, overturning, or modifying the original decision. Example triggers include 'appeal', 'appealed', and 'appealing'.",
