    "Attack(ConflictEvent)": {
        "description": "An 'Attack' event, a subtype of 'ConflictEvent', involves an aggressive action aimed at causing harm or damage to a target. It is characterized by the presence of an attacker, a target, and often an instrument used to carry out the attack. The scope includes physical, verbal, and cyber attacks. Unlike 'Demonstrate' events, which involve public displays of protest or support, 'Attack' events are marked by direct aggression and intent to harm. Example triggers include 'ambush', 'bombardment', 'take out', 'clashing', and 'raping and drugging'. The outcome typically involves harm or damage to the target, distinguishing it from events like 'TransferOwnership' or 'DeclareBankruptcy', which involve changes in ownership or financial status without direct aggression.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "target": "The 'target' is the entity or entities that the attack is directed against, identifying who or what is being harmed. It can be individuals, groups, or objects. In cases where multiple entities are targeted, each should be annotated. The 'target' is distinct from the 'attacker' and 'instrument'. Example: In 'take out the President', 'President' is the target.",
            "victim": "The 'victim' is the entity that suffers harm as a result of the attack. It can be individuals or groups and is important for understanding the impact of the event. In some cases, the 'victim' and 'target' may overlap. The 'victim' is distinct from the 'attacker'. Example: In 'raping and drugging three women', 'women' are the victims.",
            "attacker": "The 'attacker' is the entity that initiates the attack, crucial for understanding the source of aggression. It can be individuals, groups, or organizations. The 'attacker' is distinct from the 'target' and 'victim'. Example: In 'ambush by groups', 'groups' are the attackers.",
            "time": "The 'time' argument specifies when the attack occurred, important for contextualizing the event. It can be specific dates, times, or relative expressions. The 'time' is distinct from the 'place' and 'instrument'. Example: 'tonight' in 'bombardment of Baghdad continues tonight'.",
            "instrument": "The 'instrument' is the tool or method used to carry out the attack, important for understanding how the attack was executed. It can be weapons, tools, or methods. The 'instrument' is distinct from the 'attacker' and 'target'. Example: 'ak-47s and rpgs' in 'ambush with ak-47s and rpgs'.",
            "place": "The 'place' specifies the location where the attack occurred, important for contextualizing the event. It can be specific locations, cities, or regions. The 'place' is distinct from the 'time' and 'instrument'. Example: 'Baghdad' in 'bombardment of Baghdad'.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' is the entity responsible for carrying out the attack, important for understanding who is behind the attack. It can be individuals, groups, or organizations. The 'agent' is distinct from the 'target' and 'victim'. Example: 'luster' in 'raping and drugging by luster'."
