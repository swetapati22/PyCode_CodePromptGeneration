    "Convict(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "A Convict event, a subtype of JusticeEvent, occurs when a legal authority formally declares an individual guilty of a crime. This event involves a legal adjudicator, such as a judge or jury, who delivers the verdict, resulting in a formal declaration of guilt and often leading to sentencing. It is distinct from other events like Sue, Fine, and Extradite, which involve initiating legal action, imposing monetary penalties, and transferring individuals between jurisdictions, respectively. Example triggers include 'convicted', 'found guilty', and 'conviction'.",
