    "Demonstrate(ConflictEvent)": {
        "description": "A 'Demonstrate' event, classified under the ConflictEvent superclass, involves a public gathering where individuals express their views, often in opposition to a policy, action, or situation. Key triggers include terms like 'protest', 'rally', 'gather', 'campaign', 'march', 'sit-in', and 'demonstration'. These events are characterized by collective action, typically involving a significant number of participants united by a common cause or grievance. Unlike 'Riot' events, 'Demonstrate' events do not necessarily involve violence or property damage. They usually occur in specific locations and time frames and may involve interactions with law enforcement. Outcomes can range from peaceful expressions to clashes with authorities, and they are broader in scope compared to 'Strike' events, which are work-related and involve cessation of work.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "time": "The 'time' argument specifies when the demonstration took place, providing context and urgency. It can be explicit (e.g., 'yesterday', 'Saturday') or implicit (e.g., 'last week'). It may also indicate the duration (e.g., 'for several hours') or span multiple days (e.g., 'over the weekend').",
            "entity": "The 'entity' argument identifies the individuals or groups participating in the demonstration, essential for understanding involvement and motivations. Entities can be specific (e.g., 'Liana Owen', 'parents') or general (e.g., 'protesters', 'students'). Descriptions of participants (e.g., 'college and high school students') and large, unspecified groups (e.g., 'tens of thousands of people') are also included.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument specifies the location of the demonstration, crucial for understanding the geographical context and impact. Locations can be specific (e.g., 'Halifax', 'Manhattan') or general (e.g., 'plazas', 'streets'). Descriptions of settings (e.g., 'on campuses') and implied locations (e.g., 'here') are also considered. Events may occur in multiple locations simultaneously (e.g., 'from coast to coast').",
            "police": "The 'police' argument identifies law enforcement involvement, important for understanding event dynamics and potential conflicts. It includes specific actions (e.g., '70 people were arrested'), presence (e.g., 'police presence'), and indirect references (e.g., 'clashed with police'). Situations where law enforcement is involved but not explicitly mentioned (e.g., 'authorities') are also included."
