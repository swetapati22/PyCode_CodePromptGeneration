    "Die(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Die' event type, a subclass of 'LifeEvent', refers to the cessation of life of one or more individuals due to various causes such as violence, accidents, or natural causes. Key characteristics include the presence of a victim and often an agent or instrument causing the death. Example triggers include 'killed', 'died', 'fallen', and 'dead'. This event is distinct from other life events like 'Injure' or 'Birth', as it specifically denotes the end of life. The outcome of a 'Die' event is always the death of the victim(s). It can be distinguished from non-life events like 'MergeOrg' or 'TransferOwnership' by its focus on the end of life.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "time": "The 'time' argument specifies when the death occurred, providing temporal context. It can be explicit (e.g., 'Monday' in 'were killed Monday') or inferred from context (e.g., 'fallen comrades' implies a past event). Relative time expressions like 'yesterday' or 'recently' are also included. Ambiguous references require contextual interpretation (e.g., 'died during the night').",
            "place": "The 'place' argument identifies the location where the death occurred, offering spatial context. It can be specific (e.g., 'hotel' in 'died at a nearby hotel') or broader (e.g., 'battlefield'). Vague or multiple locations require additional context (e.g., 'south Baghdad' in 'hit operation center for 2nd brigade 3rd infantry zrigs south Baghdad').",
            "instrument": "The 'instrument' argument specifies the means or tool used to cause the death, highlighting the method. It can be explicit (e.g., 'missile' in 'hit by a missile') or implied (e.g., 'fire' in 'coalition forces returning fire'). Indirect instruments or complex scenarios with multiple instruments are included (e.g., 'collision' in 'collision of two Royal Navy helicopters').",
            "victim": "The 'victim' argument identifies the individual(s) who died, central to the 'Die' event type. It can be specific (e.g., 'journalists' in 'two other journalists died') or general (e.g., 'comrades' in 'bodies of fallen comrades'). Ambiguous or collective references require additional context (e.g., 'four' in 'at least four dead, two soldiers and two journalists').",
            "person": "The 'person' argument identifies individuals related to the event but not necessarily the victims, providing additional context. It can include witnesses, relatives, or colleagues (e.g., 'comrades' in 'bodies of fallen comrades'). Indirectly related persons involved in the aftermath are also included (e.g., 'American marine' in 'ask any American marine').",
            "agent": "The 'agent' argument identifies the entity responsible for causing the death, highlighting the perpetrator. It can be explicit (e.g., 'coalition' in 'missile fired by the US-led coalition warplanes') or implied (e.g., 'forces' in 'coalition forces returning fire'). Indirect agents or complex scenarios with multiple agents are included (e.g., 'forces' in 'CENTCOM says, of coalition forces returning fire')."
