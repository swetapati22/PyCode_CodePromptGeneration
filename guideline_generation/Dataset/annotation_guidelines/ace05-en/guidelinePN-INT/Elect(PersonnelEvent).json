    "Elect(PersonnelEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Elect' event type, a subclass of 'PersonnelEvent', refers to the formal selection of an individual for a position or office through a voting mechanism. This event typically occurs within governmental or organizational contexts and involves a competitive process where candidates vie for votes. Triggers for this event include terms like 'elected', 'won', and 'winning'. The outcome is the appointment of a person to a specific role, often marked by a formal announcement or ceremony. This event signifies the beginning of a new term or role, distinguishing it from 'EndPosition' events, which denote the conclusion of a tenure, and 'StartOrg' events, which focus on the creation of organizations rather than the selection of individuals.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event, such as 'elected', 'won', or 'winning'.",
            "entity": "The 'entity' argument refers to the organization or body for which the election is held, providing context about the scope and significance of the election. Examples include 'USCF' in 'Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President' and 'Zambia' in 'Chiluba was Zambia's first democratically elected president'. The entity can be a country, organization, or any formal body, and in some cases, it may be inferred from the context.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument specifies the location where the election or the announcement of the election result takes place. Examples include 'Los Angeles' in 'Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President in Los Angeles' and 'Ohio' and 'Florida' in 'Kerry won decisively not only in Ohio and Florida'. The place can also be inferred from the context or refer to a broader region or multiple locations.",
            "person": "The 'person' argument identifies the individual who is elected, such as 'Beatriz Marinello' in 'Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President' or 'Kerry' in 'Kerry won decisively not only in Ohio and Florida'. This argument highlights the subject of the election and can include multiple individuals or be inferred from titles or roles.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' argument refers to the entity or group responsible for conducting the election or making the announcement, such as 'Jordanian authorities' in 'Jordanian authorities on Monday said...' or 'USCF' in 'Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President'. The agent can be a formal electoral commission, a government body, or an organizational committee, and in some cases, it may be implied rather than explicitly stated."
