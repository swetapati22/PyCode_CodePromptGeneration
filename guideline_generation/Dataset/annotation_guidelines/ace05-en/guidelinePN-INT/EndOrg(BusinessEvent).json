    "EndOrg(BusinessEvent)": {
        "description": "The EndOrg event type, a subclass of BusinessEvent, refers to the termination or cessation of an organization or its operations. This includes the closing, shutting down, or dissolving of entities such as companies, plants, or departments. Triggers for this event type include phrases like 'is no more', 'closing', 'shutting down', and 'dissolving', indicating the end of an organization's existence or activities. Key characteristics involve identifying the organization that is ending and the location of the event. Unlike events such as 'StartOrg', which indicate the beginning of an organization, EndOrg specifically deals with the conclusion of operations. Triggers like 'opening' or 'launching' are not relevant to EndOrg, as the outcome is the cessation of activities.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "org": "The 'org' argument identifies the organization that is ending, such as a company, department, plant, or any other business entity. For example, in 'Hewlett Packard is shutting down its plant', 'plant' is the 'org'. This argument is crucial for specifying the entity ceasing operations, helping to understand the event's scope and impact. In cases with multiple organizations, focus on the one explicitly ending. The 'org' can sometimes be implicit or inferred from context, such as 'the embassy in Saudi Arabia' implying the diplomatic outpost. Edge cases include parts of larger entities, like 'Hewlett Packard's plant'.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument identifies the location where the organization is ending, such as a city, country, or specific site. For example, 'Eugene' in 'Hewlett Packard is shutting down its plant in Eugene' is the place. This argument provides geographical context, aiding in understanding the regional impact. If not explicitly mentioned, the place can sometimes be inferred from context, like 'the embassy in Saudi Arabia' implying 'Saudi Arabia'. The 'place' can also refer to specific sites within a larger location, such as 'emergency rooms' and 'trauma centers'. Edge cases include places within larger regions, like 'the embassy in Saudi Arabia' within the country of Saudi Arabia."
