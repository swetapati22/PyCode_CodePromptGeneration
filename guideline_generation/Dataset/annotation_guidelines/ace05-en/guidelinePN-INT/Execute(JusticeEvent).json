    "Execute(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Execute event type, a subclass of JusticeEvent, refers to the formal and legal act of carrying out a death sentence on a person as a form of judicial punishment. This event involves a judicial or governmental authority (agent), the person being executed (person), and the location where the execution takes place (place). Example triggers include 'executed', 'put to death', and 'execution'. Unlike other JusticeEvent types such as 'Sentence' or 'ChargeIndict', the Execute event results in the death of the person involved, which is a definitive and irreversible action. The scope of this event includes any formal execution sanctioned by legal processes and excludes extrajudicial killings or murders, which are not legally sanctioned. For instance, 'murdered' or 'killed' would not be appropriate triggers for this event type.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument refers to the location where the execution takes place, which can be a specific facility, city, state, or country. This is crucial for understanding the jurisdiction and context of the event. For example, 'executed in Texas' identifies 'Texas' as the place. The place might be explicitly stated or implied from the context, such as 'executed by the state' implying a location within the state's jurisdiction. This argument helps distinguish between different legal systems and practices.",
            "person": "The 'person' argument refers to the individual being executed, which is central to the event as it identifies the subject of the execution. The person can be identified by name, role, or pronoun, such as 'he'd be the 11th killer put to death' where 'he' or 'killer' is the person. Multiple individuals might also be involved, like 'the execution of six convicts'. This argument is crucial for understanding the human impact of the event.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' argument refers to the entity responsible for carrying out the execution, typically a state, government, or legal authority. For example, 'executed by the state' identifies 'state' as the agent. The agent can be a specific country, state, or legal body, such as 'Indonesia will delay the execution' where 'Indonesia' is the agent. The agent might also be a collective entity or implied authority, like 'we execute them' implying a governmental authority. This argument helps to understand the legal and administrative context of the execution."
