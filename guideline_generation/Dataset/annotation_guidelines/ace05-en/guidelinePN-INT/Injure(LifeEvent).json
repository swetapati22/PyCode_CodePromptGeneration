        "description": "The 'Injure' event type, a subclass of 'LifeEvent', refers to incidents where individuals suffer physical harm or damage due to an external action or accident. This event type captures scenarios where the physical well-being of one or more individuals is compromised, emphasizing the resulting harm to the victim rather than the aggressive action itself. Triggers include terms like 'wounding', 'injured', and 'hurting'. The scope includes both intentional and accidental harm, distinguishing it from events like 'Attack' which focus on the aggressive action. Ambiguous triggers like 'killed' should be interpreted in context to focus on injuries rather than fatalities.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "victim": "The 'victim' argument identifies the individual(s) who suffer physical harm in the event. Victims can be specified as groups or individuals, such as 'women', 'children', 'civilians', or 'Iraqis'. In cases where multiple victims are mentioned, each should be annotated. Indirect references to victims, such as 'those injured' or 'the wounded', should also be annotated as 'victim'.",
            "time": "The 'time' argument specifies when the injury event occurred. Time can be expressed in various formats, including specific dates, days of the week, or relative time expressions like 'earlier today'. In some cases, the time may be implied rather than explicitly stated. Vague time references like 'recently' or 'in the past' should be annotated if they provide relevant temporal context.",
            "instrument": "The 'instrument' argument identifies the tool or means used to cause the injury. Instruments can be weapons, objects, or substances that directly cause harm, such as 'bomb', 'knife', or 'poison'. In some cases, the instrument may be implied rather than explicitly stated. Indirect references to instruments, such as 'the device' or 'the weapon', should also be annotated as 'instrument'.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument specifies the location where the injury event occurred. Places can be specific locations, cities, or regions, such as 'Gaza Strip', 'city', or 'Baghdad'. In some cases, the place may be implied rather than explicitly stated. Vague place references like 'the area' or 'the site' should be annotated if they provide relevant locational context.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' argument identifies the individual or entity responsible for causing the injury. Agents can be individuals, groups, or organizations, such as 'attackers', 'Palestinian', or 'terrorists'. In some cases, the agent may be implied rather than explicitly stated. Indirect references to agents, such as 'the responsible party' or 'the attacker', should also be annotated as 'agent'."
