    "Nominate(PersonnelEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Nominate' event type, a subclass of 'PersonnelEvent', involves the formal or official selection of a person for a position, role, or task. This event is characterized by an agent (the nominator) selecting a person (the nominee) for a specific role or task, often involving an official announcement or designation. Unlike the 'StartPosition' event, which focuses on the commencement of a role, the 'Nominate' event centers on the selection process itself. Triggers such as 'appoint' or 'elect' indicate related but distinct events like 'Appoint' or 'Elect', which involve the finalization of a role rather than the nomination process. The outcome of a 'Nominate' event is the identification of a candidate for a role, but it does not necessarily imply that the nominee has assumed the position.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument specifies the location where the nomination occurs or is relevant. This can be a geographical location, an institution, or an organization. Examples include 'Boston' in 'the pope will reportedly name a new head of the troubled Boston archdiocese' and 'the company' in 'nominating his own board'. Edge cases include virtual or non-physical locations, such as 'online' or 'in the media'. Unlike the 'Place' argument in 'TransferOwnership' events, which indicates where the transfer occurs, the 'place' in 'Nominate' events provides context for the nomination process itself.",
            "person": "The 'person' argument identifies the individual being nominated. This is crucial as it specifies the nominee, the central figure in the nomination process. Examples include 'head' in 'name a new head of the troubled Boston archdiocese' and 'Chui Sai On' in 'named director of the SARS task force'. In some cases, the 'person' may be a group or collective entity, such as 'board' in 'nominating his own board'. Edge cases include ambiguous or unspecified nominees, such as 'who' in 'So any thoughts on who you uh you would name?'. Unlike the 'Person' argument in 'ArrestJail' events, which identifies the individual being detained, the 'person' in 'Nominate' events is the individual being selected for a role.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' argument identifies the entity or individual making the nomination. This is important as it specifies the nominator, the entity responsible for the selection. Examples include 'pope' in 'the pope will reportedly name a new head' and 'government' in 'named director of the SARS task force by the government'. In some cases, the 'agent' may be an organization or collective entity, such as 'he' in 'nominating his own board'. Edge cases include implicit or unspecified nominators, such as 'you' in 'So any thoughts on who you uh you would name?'. Unlike the 'Agent' argument in 'ArrestJail' events, which identifies the entity performing the arrest, the 'agent' in 'Nominate' events is the entity making the selection."
