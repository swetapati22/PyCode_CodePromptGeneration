    "PhoneWrite(ContactEvent)": {
        "description": "PhoneWrite(ContactEvent) is a subtype of ContactEvent that involves communication through written or spoken means, such as letters, emails, phone calls, or other forms of correspondence. Triggers for PhoneWrite include terms like 'correspondence', 'letters', 'calling', 'spoke', and 'delivered', indicating the act of sending or receiving messages. This event type specifically focuses on the exchange of information through written or spoken communication, rather than face-to-face interactions. PhoneWrite events typically involve multiple entities, such as the sender and receiver, and can occur in various locations, which are important for context. The outcome of a PhoneWrite event is the successful transmission of information from one party to another, documented through various forms of communication.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "entity": "The 'entity' argument refers to the individuals or groups involved in the communication, such as the sender, receiver, or any other relevant parties. In PhoneWrite events, identifying entities is crucial as it specifies who is participating in the communication. For example, in 'He sent several letters to the police and the media', 'He', 'police', and 'media' are the entities. Entities can be individuals or groups, and their roles can vary. Edge cases include situations where the entity is implied but not explicitly mentioned, such as 'letters were sent', implying a sender and receiver.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument indicates the location where the communication takes place or is directed to, which can be a physical location or a broader geographical area. In PhoneWrite events, 'place' provides context for where the communication is happening. For example, 'from a hospital in Germany' specifies the place of the communication. Places can range from specific locations like 'New York City' to broader regions like 'Africa, Asia, and the Middle East'. Edge cases include virtual places or situations where the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'calling from home'.",
            "time": "The 'time' argument refers to when the communication takes place, which can be a specific time, date, or a more general time frame. In PhoneWrite events, 'time' provides temporal context, helping to understand when the communication occurred. For example, 'yesterday' in 'spoke to her parents yesterday' indicates the time. Time can be specific, like 'August 11, 2003', or more general, like 'during that time'. Edge cases include implied times or situations where the exact time is not mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'recently' or 'last week'."
