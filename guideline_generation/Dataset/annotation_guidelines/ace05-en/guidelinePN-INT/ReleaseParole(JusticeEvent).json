    "ReleaseParole(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The ReleaseParole event involves the official release of an individual from detention or imprisonment, typically under specific conditions or supervision. This event is characterized by the transition from confinement to freedom, often involving legal or administrative decisions. Key elements include the involvement of legal authorities or institutions, the individual being released, and the conditions under which the release occurs. Example triggers include 'release', 'parole', and 'freed'. The outcome is the individual's freedom, distinguishing it from events like Convict, which result in a guilty verdict. Negative examples include events like Nominate or Marry, which do not involve release from confinement.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "entity": "The 'entity' argument refers to the organization or authority responsible for the release decision, such as a parole board, judge, or detention facility. Entities are crucial as they hold the authority to grant or deny release. Examples include 'parole board' in 'The parole board decided to release the inmate'. Entities are typically institutions or roles, distinct from agents who are individuals acting on behalf of these entities. Edge cases include implied entities, such as in 'He was released after serving 10 years'.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument specifies the location where the release occurs or where the individual was detained. Examples include 'detention center' in 'He was released from the detention center'. Places provide context about the detention environment and can refer to broader locations like a city or country. Unlike events like Demonstrate, where places are locations of protests, in ReleaseParole, places are specifically locations of detention or release. Edge cases include implied places, such as in 'He was freed after 10 years'.",
            "person": "The 'person' argument refers to the individual being released from detention. Examples include 'John' in 'The parole board decided to release John'. Persons are central to the event as they are the subjects of the release action and may be referred to by a role or identifier, such as 'prisoner'. Unlike events like Nominate, where the person is appointed to a position, in ReleaseParole, the person is freed from confinement. Edge cases include implied persons, such as in 'He was released after serving his sentence'.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' argument refers to the individual or group facilitating the release, such as a judge, warden, or parole officer. Agents execute the decision to release, as seen in 'The judge ordered the release'. Agents can be individuals or collective groups acting through representatives. Unlike entities, which are often institutions, agents are individuals acting on behalf of these entities. Edge cases include implied agents, such as in 'He was released after serving his sentence'."
