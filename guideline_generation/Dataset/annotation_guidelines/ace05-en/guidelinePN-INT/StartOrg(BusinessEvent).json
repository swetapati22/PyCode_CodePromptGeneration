    "StartOrg(BusinessEvent)": {
        "description": "The StartOrg event type refers to the initiation or establishment of an organization, business, or entity. This event is characterized by actions such as 'create', 'build', 'open', or 'launch', and is triggered by verbs like 'shape', 'opening', 'build', and 'create'. Unlike the DeclareBankruptcy event, which signifies the end or failure of an organization, the StartOrg event focuses on the inception and establishment phase. It is a subset of BusinessEvent, emphasizing the creation of new business entities or organizations, often involving agents responsible for the initiation. Key characteristics include the presence of an agent (individual or group initiating the event), the organization being established, and the location where the event takes place.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "org": "The 'org' argument represents the organization or entity being established, which is the primary focus of the StartOrg event. Examples include 'government', 'Disneyland', 'monster', and 'insurer'. This argument is crucial as it identifies the specific organization being started, distinguishing it from other types of events. In the context of StartOrg, 'org' can refer to various types of entities, including businesses, governmental bodies, or unique projects. Unlike the 'org' argument in DeclareBankruptcy, which refers to an existing entity facing financial failure, the 'org' in StartOrg is about a new or restructured entity coming into existence.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument specifies the location where the organization is being established, providing geographical context to the StartOrg event. Examples include 'Iraq', 'here', 'Sydney', and 'Japan'. This argument is important as it situates the event in a specific location, which can be critical for understanding the context and impact of the event. 'Place' can be a broader region or a specific venue, depending on the scope and nature of the organization being established. Unlike the 'place' argument in events like ArrestJail, which indicates where an arrest occurs, the 'place' in StartOrg is about where the new entity is being created.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' argument refers to the individual, group, or entity responsible for initiating the StartOrg event. Examples include 'U.S', 'leaders', 'Daily Planet Ltd', 'we', and 'AIG'. This argument is essential as it identifies the initiators of the event, providing insight into who is behind the creation of the new organization. In the context of StartOrg, 'agent' can be a person, a group of people, or an existing organization launching a new entity. Unlike the 'agent' in events like Nominate, where the agent is appointing someone to a position, the 'agent' in StartOrg is actively involved in the creation of a new organization."
