        "description": "The StartPosition event type, a subclass of PersonnelEvent, refers to the commencement of a new role or position by an individual or group. This event captures the initiation of a professional or official role, often marked by a change in title, responsibilities, or location. Key triggers include terms like 'becoming', 'return', 'replace', 'head', 'was', 'appointed', 'elected', and 'promoted'. Unlike the EndPosition event, which signifies the conclusion of a role, the StartPosition event focuses on the beginning of a new role, establishing a new professional or official status for the person or entity involved, often accompanied by a change in duties or location.",
