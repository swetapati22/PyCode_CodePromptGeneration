    "Sue(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Sue' event type, a subclass of 'JusticeEvent', involves a legal action where one party (the plaintiff) initiates a lawsuit against another party (the defendant) in a court of law. This event is characterized by the formal process of bringing a legal claim, typically involving a judicial authority (adjudicator) and occurring at a specific location (place). Unlike other JusticeEvent types such as 'ArrestJail' or 'Execute', the 'Sue' event focuses on legal dispute resolution rather than physical detention or capital punishment. Example triggers include 'lawsuit', 'sued', and 'pursue'. The outcome is typically a court ruling or settlement, not physical custody or execution. The scope includes civil lawsuits, class actions, and other legal claims where the plaintiff seeks redress or compensation through judicial means.",

            "adjudicator": "The 'adjudicator' in a 'Sue' event refers to the judicial authority or court that presides over the lawsuit, such as a judge, a panel of judges, or a specific court. The adjudicator ensures fair legal proceedings and renders decisions based on evidence and arguments. Examples include 'The judge approved the settlement' and 'The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff'. In some cases, the adjudicator may be an arbitration panel or tribunal. Edge cases include inferred adjudicators, such as 'The lawsuit was filed in federal court.'",
            "plaintiff": "The 'plaintiff' in a 'Sue' event is the party that initiates the lawsuit, seeking legal remedy or compensation from the defendant. The plaintiff can be an individual, a group, or an organization. Examples include 'The shareholders sued the company for fraud' and 'The victims' families filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer'. In class actions, the plaintiff represents a larger group with similar claims. Edge cases include inferred plaintiffs, such as 'A lawsuit was filed against the company.'",
            "defendant": "The 'defendant' in a 'Sue' event is the party against whom the lawsuit is filed, accused of causing harm or wrongdoing. The defendant can be an individual, a group, or an organization. Examples include 'The company was sued by its employees' and 'The government was named as the defendant in the lawsuit'. There may be multiple defendants in a single lawsuit. Edge cases include inferred defendants, such as 'The lawsuit targeted several high-profile executives.'",
            "place": "The 'place' in a 'Sue' event refers to the location where the lawsuit is filed or where the legal proceedings take place, such as a specific court, city, state, or country. Examples include 'The lawsuit was filed in Washington' and 'The case was heard in the New York Supreme Court'. The place may also refer to the jurisdiction or venue of the lawsuit. Edge cases include inferred places, such as 'The lawsuit was filed in a local court.'"
