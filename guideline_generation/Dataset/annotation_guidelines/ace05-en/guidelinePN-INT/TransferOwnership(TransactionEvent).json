    "TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": "The TransferOwnership event involves the transfer of ownership of an item or asset from one entity to another. This event is characterized by the presence of a giver (or seller), a recipient (or buyer), and the item or asset being transferred. It may also include details such as time, place, and price. Unlike the TransferMoney event, which focuses on monetary funds, TransferOwnership specifically involves tangible or intangible assets. Example triggers include 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', 'provide', and 'export'. The outcome is a change in ownership, distinguishing it from events like DeclareBankruptcy or Sue, which do not involve ownership transfer.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "giver": "The giver is the entity that transfers ownership of the item or asset. This can be an individual or an organization. For example, 'Vivendi' in 'Vivendi wants to sell Universal Studios' is the giver. Context clues can help identify the giver if not explicitly mentioned, such as 'North Korea' in 'North Korea exported missiles'. The giver is the original owner, distinguishing it from the recipient.",
            "thing": "The thing refers to the item or asset being transferred, which can be tangible, like 'missiles' in 'exported missiles', or intangible, like 'rights' in 'sold the rights'. It is the central focus of the transfer, distinguishing it from other elements like price or time. For example, 'apartment' in 'providing an apartment' is the thing.",
            "recipient": "The recipient is the entity that receives ownership of the item or asset. This can be an individual or an organization. For example, 'nanny' in 'providing their grandson's nanny with an apartment' is the recipient. Context clues can help identify the recipient if not explicitly mentioned, such as 'buyers' in 'holding talks with buyers'. The recipient is the new owner, distinguishing it from the giver.",
            "time": "The time refers to when the transfer of ownership takes place. It can be a specific date, year, or a more general time frame. For example, 'in 2000' in 'providing an apartment in 2000' is the time. The time helps contextualize the event, distinguishing it from similar events that may occur at different times.",
            "price": "The price refers to the monetary value exchanged for the item or asset. It can be a specific amount or a range. For example, 'US$580 million' in 'exported US$580 million worth of missiles' is the price. The price helps quantify the value of the transaction, distinguishing it from non-monetary transfers.",
            "artifact": "The artifact refers to the specific item or asset being transferred, which can be tangible, like 'missiles' in 'exported missiles', or intangible, like 'rights' in 'sold the rights'. It is the central focus of the transfer, distinguishing it from other elements like price or time. For example, 'apartment' in 'providing an apartment' is the artifact.",
            "beneficiary": "The beneficiary is the entity that benefits from the transfer, even if they are not the direct recipient. This can be an individual or an organization. For example, 'nanny' in 'providing their grandson's nanny with an apartment' is the beneficiary. The beneficiary helps identify who gains from the transfer, distinguishing it from the direct recipient.",
            "buyer": "The buyer is the entity that purchases the item or asset. This can be an individual or an organization. For example, 'Iran, Pakistan, Libya' in 'exported missiles to Iran, Pakistan, Libya' are buyers. Context clues can help identify the buyer if not explicitly mentioned, such as 'buyers' in 'holding talks with buyers'. The buyer is the new owner, distinguishing it from the giver.",
            "place": "The place refers to the location where the transfer of ownership takes place. It can be a specific city, country, or a more general location. For example, 'Belgrade' in 'providing an apartment in Belgrade' is the place. The place helps contextualize the event, distinguishing it from similar events that may occur in different locations.",
            "seller": "The seller is the entity that sells the item or asset. This can be an individual or an organization. For example, 'Vivendi' in 'Vivendi wants to sell Universal Studios' is the seller. Context clues can help identify the seller if not explicitly mentioned, such as 'unit' in 'interested in the unit's assets'. The seller is the original owner, distinguishing it from the buyer."
