        "description": "A TrialHearing event involves a formal examination of evidence before a judge, and typically a jury, to decide guilt in criminal or civil proceedings. Key characteristics include the presence of an adjudicator (e.g., judge or court), a defendant, a prosecutor, and a specific location where the trial or hearing occurs. The event encompasses the entire process of presenting evidence, examining witnesses, and making legal arguments. Outcomes can include a verdict of guilty or not guilty, or a decision to proceed to a full trial. Example triggers include 'hearing', 'trial', and 'tried'. This event type does not cover the sentencing phase, which is part of a 'Convict' event.",

Examples include 'prosecutors presented enough evidence' and 'FL prosecutors have to do is ask'.",
            "Defendant": "The defendant is the person or entity accused of a crime or wrongdoing and is being tried in the trial or hearing. Defendants can be individuals or groups and must respond to the charges and present a defense. Examples include 'Nichols on murder charges' and 'Markovic and 10 other officials'.",
            "Place": "The place is the location where the trial or hearing takes place, such as a city, state, or specific court. It provides the jurisdiction and venue for the trial. Examples include 'an Oklahoma City judge' and 'The Belgrade district court'."
