      "person": "The 'person' argument refers to the individual being executed, which is central to the event as it identifies the subject of the execution. The person can be identified by name, role, or pronoun, such as 'he'd be the 11th killer put to death' where 'he' or 'killer' is the person. Multiple individuals might also be involved, like 'the execution of six convicts'. This argument is crucial for understanding the human impact of the event.",
      "agent": "The 'agent' argument refers to the entity responsible for carrying out the execution, typically a state, government, or legal authority. For example, 'executed by the state' identifies 'state' as the agent. The agent can be a specific country, state, or legal body, such as 'Indonesia will delay the execution' where 'Indonesia' is the agent. The agent might also be a collective entity or implied authority, like 'we execute them' implying a governmental authority. This argument helps to understand the legal and administrative context of the execution."

Unlike the 'StartPosition' event, which focuses on the commencement of a role, the 'Nominate' event centers on the selection process itself. Triggers such as 'appoint' or 'elect' indicate related but distinct events like 'Appoint' or 'Elect', which involve the finalization of a role rather than the nomination process.

In some cases, the 'person' may be a group or collective entity, such as 'board' in 'nominating his own board'. Edge cases include ambiguous or unspecified nominees, such as 'who' in 'So any thoughts on who you uh you would name?'.

Edge cases include situations where the entity is implied but not explicitly mentioned, such as 'letters were sent', implying a sender and receiver.",
      "place": "The 'place' argument indicates the location where the communication takes place or is directed to, which can be a physical location or a broader geographical area. In PhoneWrite events, 'place' provides context for where the communication is happening. For example, 'from a hospital in Germany' specifies the place of the communication.

Edge cases include implied entities, such as in 'He was released after serving 10 years'.",
      "place": "The 'place' argument specifies the location where the release occurs or where the individual was detained. Examples include 'detention center' in 'He was released from the detention center'. Places provide context about the detention environment and can refer to broader locations like a city or country.

Edge cases include implied places, such as in 'He was freed after 10 years'.",
      "person": "The 'person' argument refers to the individual being released from detention. Examples include 'John' in 'The parole board decided to release John'. Persons are central to the event as they are the subjects of the release action and may be referred to by a role or identifier, such as 'prisoner'.
