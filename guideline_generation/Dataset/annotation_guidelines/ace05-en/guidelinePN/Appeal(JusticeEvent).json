        "description": [
            "An 'Appeal' event in the context of justice refers to a formal request made to a higher court to review and change the decision of a lower court. Example triggers include 'appeal', 'appealed', 'appealing'.",
            "The 'Appeal' event is characterized by the involvement of a higher judicial authority (adjudicator) and typically follows a prior judgment or decision. It is distinct from initial trials or hearings.",
            "Unlike a 'Convict' event, which focuses on the outcome of a trial (i.e., the conviction of a defendant), an 'Appeal' event centers on the process of challenging that outcome.",
            "Triggers such as 'convicted' or 'sentenced' are indicative of 'Convict' or 'Sentence' events, not 'Appeal' events. An 'Appeal' event specifically involves the act of seeking a review of a decision.",
            "The outcome of an 'Appeal' event can vary, including the upholding, overturning, or modification of the original decision. This is different from a 'TrialHearing' event, which focuses on the presentation of evidence and arguments in a judicial setting."

        "adjudicator": [
            "The 'adjudicator' in an 'Appeal' event refers to the higher court or judicial authority that reviews the appeal. For example, 'Supreme Court' or 'Federal Court'.",
            "The role of the 'adjudicator' is crucial as they have the authority to uphold, overturn, or modify the original decision. Example: 'The Supreme Court reviewed the appeal.'",
            "In some cases, the 'adjudicator' may be a specific judge or panel of judges within the higher court. Example: 'Judge Smith of the appellate court.'",
            "Unlike the 'adjudicator' in a 'TrialHearing' event, who presides over the presentation of evidence, the 'adjudicator' in an 'Appeal' event focuses on reviewing the legal basis of the prior decision.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the 'adjudicator' is a special tribunal or an international court. Example: 'The International Court of Justice reviewed the appeal.'"
        ],
        "plaintiff": [
            "The 'plaintiff' in an 'Appeal' event is the party who initiates the appeal, seeking a review of the lower court's decision. Example: 'Anwar Ibrahim appealed the decision.'",
            "The 'plaintiff' is typically the party dissatisfied with the original judgment, which could be an individual, organization, or government entity. Example: 'The school districts appealed the ruling.'",
            "In some cases, the 'plaintiff' may be referred to as the 'appellant'. Example: 'The appellant argued that the lower court erred in its judgment.'",
            "Unlike the 'defendant' in a 'Convict' event, who is the party being judged, the 'plaintiff' in an 'Appeal' event is the one challenging the judgment.",
            "Edge cases include situations where multiple parties jointly file an appeal. Example: 'Five convicts appealed to the Supreme Court.'"
        ],
        "prosecutor": [
            "The 'prosecutor' in an 'Appeal' event is the legal representative who argues against the appeal, typically representing the state or the original plaintiff. Example: 'The prosecutor argued to uphold the conviction.'",
            "The role of the 'prosecutor' is to defend the original decision and provide reasons why the appeal should be denied. Example: 'The prosecutor presented evidence to support the lower court's ruling.'",
            "In some cases, the 'prosecutor' may be a team of legal representatives. Example: 'The prosecution team argued against the appeal.'",
            "Unlike the 'prosecutor' in a 'TrialHearing' event, who presents the case against the defendant, the 'prosecutor' in an 'Appeal' event focuses on defending the prior judgment.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the 'prosecutor' is a special counsel or an international legal representative. Example: 'The special prosecutor argued before the appellate court.'"
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "The 'defendant' in an 'Appeal' event is the party against whom the appeal is filed, often the party who won the original case. Example: 'The defendant responded to the appeal.'",
            "The 'defendant' may be an individual, organization, or government entity that seeks to maintain the original judgment. Example: 'The government was the defendant in the appeal.'",
            "In some cases, the 'defendant' may be referred to as the 'respondent'. Example: 'The respondent argued that the lower court's decision was correct.'",
            "Unlike the 'defendant' in a 'Convict' event, who is the party being judged, the 'defendant' in an 'Appeal' event is the one defending the judgment.",
            "Edge cases include situations where multiple parties are named as defendants in the appeal. Example: 'Several companies were defendants in the appeal.'"
        ],
        "place": [
            "The 'place' in an 'Appeal' event refers to the location where the appeal is filed or heard, typically a higher court. Example: 'The appeal was filed in Washington.'",
            "The 'place' is important as it indicates the jurisdiction and the specific court handling the appeal. Example: 'The appeal was heard in the Federal Court in Malaysia.'",
            "In some cases, the 'place' may refer to the broader geographical location relevant to the appeal. Example: 'The appeal was considered in Indonesia.'",
            "Unlike the 'place' in a 'TrialHearing' event, which is the location of the initial trial, the 'place' in an 'Appeal' event is the location of the appellate court.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the 'place' is an international court or tribunal. Example: 'The appeal was heard at the International Court of Justice.'"
