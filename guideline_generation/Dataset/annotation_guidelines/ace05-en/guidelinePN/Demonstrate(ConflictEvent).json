        "description": [
            "A 'Demonstrate' event, under the ConflictEvent superclass, involves a public gathering of individuals expressing their views, often in opposition to a policy, action, or situation. Example triggers include 'protest', 'rally', 'gather', and 'campaign'.",
            "This event type is characterized by collective action, typically involving a significant number of participants who are united by a common cause or grievance. Unlike a 'Riot' event, a 'Demonstrate' event does not necessarily involve violence or property damage.",
            "Key characteristics of a 'Demonstrate' event include the presence of a group (entity), a specific location (place), and often a time frame. The event may also involve interactions with law enforcement (police).",
            "Triggers such as 'march', 'sit-in', and 'demonstration' are indicative of a 'Demonstrate' event. Unlike 'Meeting' events, which are more formal and organized, 'Demonstrate' events are typically more spontaneous and driven by public sentiment.",
            "Outcomes of a 'Demonstrate' event can vary from peaceful expression of views to clashes with authorities. Unlike 'Strike' events, which are work-related and involve cessation of work, 'Demonstrate' events are broader in scope and can occur in various public spaces."

            "In some cases, the 'time' argument may be implicit, inferred from the context rather than explicitly stated. Example: 'last week'.",
            "The 'time' argument can also indicate the duration of the event, providing insights into its scale and impact. Example: 'for several hours'.",
