        "description": [
            "The 'Die' event type, a subclass of 'LifeEvent', refers to the cessation of life of one or more individuals. Example triggers include 'killed', 'died', 'fallen', and 'dead'.",
            "This event type captures scenarios where a person or group of people lose their lives due to various causes such as violence, accidents, or natural causes. Key characteristics include the presence of a victim and often an agent or instrument causing the death.",
            "Unlike other life events such as 'Injure' or 'Birth', the 'Die' event specifically denotes the end of life. For instance, 'injured' indicates harm but not death, whereas 'born' indicates the beginning of life.",
            "Triggers like 'killed' and 'died' are indicative of the 'Die' event type, whereas triggers like 'injured' or 'hurt' are not. The outcome of a 'Die' event is always the death of the victim(s).",
            "The 'Die' event can be distinguished from events like 'MergeOrg' or 'TransferOwnership' by its focus on the end of life. For example, 'merged' in a business context does not imply death, and 'providing' in a transaction context refers to the transfer of ownership, not the cessation of life."

            "In some cases, the exact time may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context. Example: 'fallen comrades' implies a past event.",
            "The 'time' argument can also include relative time expressions such as 'yesterday', 'last week', or 'recently'. Example: 'died recently' indicates a recent event.",

        "place": [
            "The 'place' argument identifies the location where the death occurred. It provides spatial context to the event. Example: 'houses' in 'were killed Monday when their houses were hit'.",
