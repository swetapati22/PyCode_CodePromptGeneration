        "description": [
            "The EndPosition event type, a subclass of PersonnelEvent, refers to the conclusion of an individual's role or position within an organization or entity. This event is typically triggered by terms indicating the end of a tenure, such as 'former', 'previously', 'dismissed', or 'retired'.",
            "This event type captures scenarios where a person no longer holds a specific position, often due to resignation, termination, retirement, or other reasons. Example triggers include 'resigned', 'stepped down', and 'left'.",
            "Unlike the StartPosition event, which marks the beginning of a role, the EndPosition event specifically denotes the cessation of a role. For instance, 'former president' indicates an EndPosition event, whereas 'newly appointed president' would indicate a StartPosition event.",
            "The EndPosition event is characterized by the presence of a person who has ended their role, the position they held, the entity or organization they were part of, and optionally, the time and place of this event. Example: 'John Doe, who was previously the CEO of XYZ Corp, retired last month.'",
            "Triggers such as 'retired', 'quit', and 'no longer' are indicative of the EndPosition event type. Unlike events like DeclareBankruptcy or Marry, which involve financial or personal life changes, EndPosition is strictly about professional role changes."

            "The 'time' argument specifies when the EndPosition event occurred. It provides temporal context to the event. Example: 'John Doe retired last month.' Here, 'last month' is the time argument.",
            "This argument is crucial for understanding the timeline of the personnel change. Example: 'She stepped down as CEO in 2020.' The year '2020' is the time argument.",
            "In some cases, the time may be implicit or relative. Example: 'He was dismissed recently.' The word 'recently' serves as the time argument.",
            "The 'time' argument can also be a specific date or period. Example: 'He left his position on January 1st.' Here, 'January 1st' is the time argument.",
            "Edge cases include vague time references like 'a few years ago' or 'in the past'. These still qualify as valid time arguments. Example: 'She resigned a few years ago.'"

        "entity": [

            "In some cases, multiple entities may be involved. Example: 'He previously held positions at Microsoft and Apple.' Both 'Microsoft' and 'Apple' are entities.",
            "Edge cases include informal or colloquial references to entities. Example: 'She quit her job at the local grocery store.' Here, 'local grocery store' is the entity."

            "The position can be specific or general. Example: 'He was a senior engineer.' Here, 'senior engineer' is the position.",
            "In some cases, the position may be implied or described in broader terms. Example: 'She left her executive role.' The term 'executive role' serves as the position.",
            "Edge cases include roles that are not formally titled but understood in context. Example: 'He quit his job as a team leader.' Here, 'team leader' is the position."
