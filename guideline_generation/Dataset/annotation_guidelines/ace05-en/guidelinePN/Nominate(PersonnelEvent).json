            "The 'Nominate' event type, a subclass of 'PersonnelEvent', involves the formal or official selection of a person for a position, role, or task. Example triggers include 'name', 'nominating', and 'designated'.",
            "This event type is characterized by an agent (the nominator) selecting a person (the nominee) for a specific role or task. The nomination is often formal and may involve an official announcement or designation.",
            "Unlike the 'StartPosition' event, which focuses on the commencement of a role, the 'Nominate' event centers on the selection process itself. For instance, 'becoming' is a trigger for 'StartPosition', not 'Nominate'.",
            "Triggers such as 'appoint' or 'elect' are indicative of related but distinct events like 'Appoint' or 'Elect', which involve the finalization of a role rather than the nomination process.",
            "The outcome of a 'Nominate' event is the identification of a candidate for a role, but it does not necessarily imply that the nominee has assumed the position. This distinguishes it from events where the role is already being performed."

            "The 'place' argument specifies the location where the nomination occurs or is relevant. For example, 'Boston' in 'the pope will reportedly name a new head of the troubled Boston archdiocese'.",
            "This argument is important for contextualizing the nomination within a specific geographical or organizational setting. For instance, 'Guangdong Province' in 'designated representatives to visit neighboring Guangdong Province'.",
            "In some cases, the 'place' may refer to an institution or organization rather than a physical location. For example, 'the company' in 'nominating his own board'.",
            "Edge cases include virtual or non-physical locations, such as 'online' or 'in the media'. For example, 'named director of the SARS task force by the government' does not specify a physical place but implies an organizational context.",

            "In some cases, the 'person' may be a group or collective entity, such as 'board' in 'nominating his own board'.",
            "Edge cases include ambiguous or unspecified nominees, such as 'who' in 'So any thoughts on who you uh you would name?'.",

            "In some cases, the 'agent' may be an organization or collective entity, such as 'he' in 'nominating his own board'.",
