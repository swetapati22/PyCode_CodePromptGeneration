            "PhoneWrite is a subtype of ContactEvent that involves the act of communication through written or spoken means, such as letters, emails, phone calls, or other forms of correspondence.",
            "Triggers for PhoneWrite include words like 'correspondence', 'letters', 'calling', 'spoke', and 'delivered', which indicate the act of sending or receiving messages.",
            "Unlike other ContactEvents, PhoneWrite specifically focuses on the exchange of information through written or spoken communication, rather than face-to-face interactions.",
            "PhoneWrite events often involve multiple entities, such as the sender and receiver, and can occur in various places, which are important to identify for context.",
            "The outcome of a PhoneWrite event is the successful transmission of information from one party to another, which can be documented through various forms of communication."

        "entity": [
            "The 'entity' argument refers to the individuals or groups involved in the communication. This can include the sender, receiver, or any other relevant parties.",
            "In the context of PhoneWrite, 'entity' is crucial as it identifies who is participating in the communication. For example, in 'He sent several letters to the police and the media', 'He', 'police', and 'media' are the entities.",
            "Entities can be individuals or groups, and their roles can vary. For instance, in 'the 19-year-old army private spoke to her parents', 'private' and 'parents' are the entities involved in the communication.",
            "Unlike other event types, the 'entity' in PhoneWrite is specifically related to those who are part of the communication process, not just any person mentioned in the text.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the entity is implied but not explicitly mentioned. For example, 'letters were sent' implies a sender and receiver, even if they are not named."

        "place": [
            "The 'place' argument indicates the location where the communication takes place or is directed to. This can be a physical location or a broader geographical area.",
            "In PhoneWrite events, 'place' helps provide context for where the communication is happening. For example, 'from a hospital in Germany' specifies the place of the communication.",
            "Places can range from specific locations like 'New York City' to broader regions like 'Africa, Asia, and the Middle East'.",
            "Unlike other events where place might indicate where an action occurs, in PhoneWrite, it specifically relates to the location relevant to the communication process.",
            "Edge cases include virtual places or situations where the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'calling from home'."

            "The 'time' argument refers to when the communication takes place. This can be a specific time, date, or a more general time frame.",
            "In PhoneWrite events, 'time' provides temporal context, helping to understand when the communication occurred. For example, 'yesterday' in 'spoke to her parents yesterday' indicates the time.",
            "Time can be specific, like 'August 11, 2003', or more general, like 'during that time'.",
            "Unlike other events where time might indicate the duration of an action, in PhoneWrite, it specifically relates to when the communication happened.",
            "Edge cases include implied times or situations where the exact time is not mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'recently' or 'last week'."
