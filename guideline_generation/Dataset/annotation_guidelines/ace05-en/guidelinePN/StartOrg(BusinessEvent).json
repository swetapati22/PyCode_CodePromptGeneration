            "The StartOrg event type refers to the initiation or establishment of an organization, business, or entity. This event is characterized by actions such as 'create', 'build', 'open', or 'launch'.",
            "Triggers for the StartOrg event include verbs like 'shape', 'opening', 'build', and 'create', which indicate the beginning or formation of an organization.",
            "Unlike the DeclareBankruptcy event, which signifies the end or failure of an organization, the StartOrg event focuses on the inception and establishment phase.",
            "The StartOrg event is a subset of BusinessEvent, emphasizing the creation of new business entities or organizations, often involving agents who are responsible for the initiation.",
            "Key characteristics of the StartOrg event include the presence of an agent (individual or group initiating the event), the organization being established, and the location where the event takes place."

            "Unlike the 'agent' in events like Nominate, where the agent is appointing someone to a position, the 'agent' in StartOrg is actively involved in the creation of a new organization."
