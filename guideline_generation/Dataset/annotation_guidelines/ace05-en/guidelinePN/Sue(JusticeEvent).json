        "description": [
            "The 'Sue' event type, a subclass of 'JusticeEvent', involves a legal action where one party (the plaintiff) initiates a lawsuit against another party (the defendant) in a court of law. Example triggers include 'lawsuit', 'sued', and 'pursue'.",
            "A 'Sue' event is characterized by the formal process of bringing a legal claim against another party, typically involving a judicial authority (adjudicator) and occurring at a specific location (place).",
            "Unlike other JusticeEvent types such as 'ArrestJail' or 'Execute', the 'Sue' event does not involve physical detention or capital punishment but rather a legal dispute resolution process.",
            "Triggers such as 'arrested' or 'executed' are indicative of 'ArrestJail' or 'Execute' events, respectively, and not 'Sue' events. The outcome of a 'Sue' event is typically a court ruling or settlement, not physical custody or execution.",
            "The scope of a 'Sue' event includes civil lawsuits, class actions, and other legal claims where the plaintiff seeks redress or compensation from the defendant through judicial means."

        "adjudicator": [
            "The 'adjudicator' in a 'Sue' event refers to the judicial authority or court that presides over the lawsuit. This can be a judge, a panel of judges, or a specific court. Example: 'The judge approved the settlement.'",
            "The role of the 'adjudicator' is to ensure that the legal proceedings are conducted fairly and to render a decision based on the evidence and arguments presented. Example: 'The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff.'",
            "In some cases, the 'adjudicator' may be an arbitration panel or a tribunal, especially in non-traditional legal settings. Example: 'The arbitration panel found the defendant liable.'",
            "Unlike the 'plaintiff' or 'defendant', the 'adjudicator' is a neutral party responsible for adjudicating the dispute. Example: 'The court dismissed the case due to lack of evidence.'",
            "Edge cases include situations where the 'adjudicator' is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'The lawsuit was filed in federal court.'"
        ],
        "plaintiff": [
            "The 'plaintiff' in a 'Sue' event is the party that initiates the lawsuit, seeking legal remedy or compensation from the defendant. Example: 'The shareholders sued the company for fraud.'",
            "The 'plaintiff' can be an individual, a group of individuals, or an organization. Example: 'The victims' families filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer.'",
            "In class action lawsuits, the 'plaintiff' represents a larger group of people with similar claims. Example: 'The class action was brought by former employees.'",
            "Unlike the 'defendant', the 'plaintiff' is the party alleging harm or seeking redress. Example: 'The consumers sued the retailer for false advertising.'",
            "Edge cases include situations where the 'plaintiff' is not explicitly named but can be inferred from the context, such as 'A lawsuit was filed against the company.'"
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "The 'defendant' in a 'Sue' event is the party against whom the lawsuit is filed, accused of causing harm or wrongdoing. Example: 'The company was sued by its employees.'",
            "The 'defendant' can be an individual, a group of individuals, or an organization. Example: 'The government was named as the defendant in the lawsuit.'",
            "In some cases, there may be multiple defendants in a single lawsuit. Example: 'The lawsuit named several pharmaceutical companies as defendants.'",
            "Unlike the 'plaintiff', the 'defendant' is the party responding to the allegations and defending against the claims. Example: 'The defendant denied all allegations of misconduct.'",
            "Edge cases include situations where the 'defendant' is not explicitly named but can be inferred from the context, such as 'The lawsuit targeted several high-profile executives.'"
        ],
        "place": [
            "The 'place' in a 'Sue' event refers to the location where the lawsuit is filed or where the legal proceedings take place. Example: 'The lawsuit was filed in Washington.'",
            "The 'place' can be a specific court, city, state, or country. Example: 'The case was heard in the New York Supreme Court.'",
            "In some cases, the 'place' may refer to the jurisdiction or venue of the lawsuit. Example: 'The lawsuit was transferred to federal court.'",
            "Unlike other event types where 'place' might refer to a physical location of an incident, in 'Sue' events, it specifically refers to the legal venue. Example: 'The trial took place in Los Angeles.'",
            "Edge cases include situations where the 'place' is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'The lawsuit was filed in a local court.'"
