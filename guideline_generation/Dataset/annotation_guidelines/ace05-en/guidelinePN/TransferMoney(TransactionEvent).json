            "The TransferMoney event involves the movement of money from one entity (the giver) to another (the recipient). This event is characterized by a financial transaction where funds are transferred, often with a specified purpose or beneficiary.",
            "Triggers for the TransferMoney event include verbs such as 'give', 'pay', 'send', 'transfer', and 'donate'. These triggers indicate the action of moving money from one party to another.",
            "Unlike other TransactionEvents, the TransferMoney event specifically involves the transfer of monetary value. For example, 'paying a bill' or 'donating to a charity' are instances of TransferMoney, whereas 'buying a product' might be more aligned with a Purchase event.",
            "The key characteristics of the TransferMoney event include the presence of a giver, a recipient, and the money being transferred. Additional details such as the time, place, and beneficiary can provide further context but are not always necessary.",
            "Negative examples help clarify the scope: 'charging someone with a crime' (ChargeIndict) or 'writing a letter' (PhoneWrite) are not TransferMoney events, as they do not involve the transfer of money."
