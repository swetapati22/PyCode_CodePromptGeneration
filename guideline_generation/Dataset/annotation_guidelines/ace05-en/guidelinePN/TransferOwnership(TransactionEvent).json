            "The TransferOwnership event involves the transfer of ownership of an item or asset from one entity to another. Example triggers include 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', 'provide', and 'export'.",
            "This event type is characterized by the presence of a giver (or seller), a recipient (or buyer), and the item or asset being transferred. The transaction may also include details such as time, place, and price.",
            "Unlike the TransferMoney event, which focuses on the transfer of monetary funds, the TransferOwnership event specifically involves the transfer of tangible or intangible assets.",
            "Triggers such as 'sell' and 'buy' are indicative of the TransferOwnership event, whereas triggers like 'donate' or 'gift' may indicate a different type of event, such as a DonationEvent.",
            "The outcome of a TransferOwnership event is the change in ownership of the specified item or asset, distinguishing it from events like DeclareBankruptcy or Sue, which do not involve the transfer of ownership."
