        "description": [
            "The Transport event, a subtype of MovementEvent, involves the movement of entities (people, objects, etc.) from one location to another. Example triggers include 'transport', 'deploying', 'cross', 'tours', and 'back'.",
            "This event type captures scenarios where an entity is physically moved from an origin to a destination, often involving a vehicle or agent facilitating the movement. Key characteristics include the presence of an origin, destination, and the entity being moved.",
            "Unlike other MovementEvent subtypes, Transport specifically requires the movement to be facilitated by an agent or vehicle. For instance, 'deploying' troops involves an agent (e.g., a country) and a destination (e.g., a region).",
            "Triggers such as 'acquitted' or 'sentences' are indicative of JusticeEvent types and not Transport. Transport events focus on physical relocation rather than legal or financial transactions.",
            "The outcome of a Transport event is the successful relocation of the entity from the origin to the destination. This differs from events like TransferMoney, where the outcome is a financial transaction rather than physical movement."

        "origin": [
            "The origin is the starting point of the transport event. It indicates where the entity was located before the movement. For example, in 'trains running to and from southern Sudan', 'southern Sudan' is the origin.",
            "The origin is crucial for understanding the full context of the movement. It helps to establish the initial location of the entity. For instance, 'from Malaysia' in 'cross the border between Malaysia and Singapore'.",
            "In some cases, the origin may be implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'deploying some of Iraq's exiles' implies that the origin is Iraq.",
            "The origin can be a specific place, country, or region. For example, 'from Egypt' in 'suspended tours to Egypt and Turkey'.",
            "Unlike the destination, the origin is where the movement begins. For example, 'from the country' in 'deploying some of Iraq's exiles around the country'."

        "victim": [
            "The victim in a Transport event refers to the entity being moved, often under duress or without consent. For example, 'abducted women and children' in 'used to transport abducted women and children'.",
            "The victim is important for identifying the affected parties in the event. For instance, 'who' in 'Mr. Chalabi, who was assisted by U.S. forces in getting back into Iraq'.",
            "In some contexts, the victim may be a group of people or individuals. For example, 'people' in 'about 90,000 people cross the border'.",
            "The victim can also be an entity that is indirectly affected by the transport. For example, 'dissidents' in 'deploying some of Iraq's exiles and internal dissidents'.",
            "Unlike the agent, the victim is the entity being moved rather than the one facilitating the movement. For example, 'tourists' in 'suspended tours to Egypt and Turkey for Chinese tourists'."

        "vehicle": [
            "The vehicle is the means of transportation used in the event. It can be any mode of transport such as trains, cars, planes, etc. For example, 'trains' in 'trains running to and from southern Sudan'.",

            "In some cases, the vehicle may be implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'deploying' implies the use of military vehicles or aircraft.",
            "The vehicle can also be a service or organization facilitating the transport. For example, 'agencies' in 'major travel agencies have temporarily suspended tours'.",
            "Unlike the agent, the vehicle is the physical means of transport rather than the entity organizing the movement. For example, 'trains' in 'trains running to and from southern Sudan'."

            "The time indicates when the transport event occurs. It provides temporal context to the movement. For example, 'last year' in 'In last year's trial'.",
