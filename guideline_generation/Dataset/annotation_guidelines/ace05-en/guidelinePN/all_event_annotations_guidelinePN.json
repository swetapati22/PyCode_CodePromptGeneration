      "An 'Acquit' event in the context of a JusticeEvent refers to a legal decision where a defendant is formally declared not guilty of the charges against them. Example triggers include 'acquitted', 'found not guilty', and 'walk free'.",
      "The 'Acquit' event is characterized by the involvement of a judicial authority (adjudicator) who delivers the verdict, and a defendant who is the subject of the acquittal. Unlike a 'Pardon' event, which involves forgiveness of a crime, an 'Acquit' event signifies that the defendant was not found guilty in the first place.",
      "Key characteristics of an 'Acquit' event include the formal legal process and the outcome of the defendant being cleared of charges. This event does not imply any punishment or penalty, unlike a 'Fine' event where a monetary penalty is imposed.",
      "Triggers such as 'acquitted' and 'found not guilty' are indicative of an 'Acquit' event, whereas triggers like 'pardoned' or 'fined' indicate different JusticeEvents. The outcome of an 'Acquit' event is the defendant's release from legal charges, contrasting with the 'Appeal' event where the legal process is ongoing.",
      "In an 'Acquit' event, the focus is on the judicial decision that clears the defendant of charges. This is different from an 'Injure' event, which involves physical harm, or a 'Divorce' event, which pertains to the dissolution of a marriage. The 'Acquit' event is strictly related to legal exoneration."
