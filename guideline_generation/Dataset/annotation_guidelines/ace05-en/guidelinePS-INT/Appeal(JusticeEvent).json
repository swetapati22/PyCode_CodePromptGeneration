    "Appeal(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "An 'Appeal' event in the context of justice refers to a formal request made to a higher court to review and potentially change the decision of a lower court. This event involves a plaintiff who is dissatisfied with the original court's decision and seeks a review from a higher authority. Key characteristics include the involvement of a higher court (adjudicator) and the original decision being contested. Unlike initiating a legal action ('Sue'), an 'Appeal' is a continuation of an existing legal process. The outcome can result in the original decision being upheld, reversed, or modified, distinguishing it from events like 'Pardon' or 'ReleaseParole', which involve clemency or conditional release rather than judicial review. Example triggers include 'appeal', 'appealed', and 'appealing'.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The 'adjudicator' in an 'Appeal' event is the higher court or judicial body that reviews the appeal. This can be a specific judge, a panel of judges, or a higher court such as the 'Supreme Court' or 'Court of Appeals'. The adjudicator is not a party to the case but the authority that has the power to uphold, reverse, or modify the original decision.",
            "plaintiff": "The 'plaintiff' in an 'Appeal' event is the individual or entity that initiates the appeal, seeking a review of the original court's decision. The plaintiff is typically dissatisfied with the original decision and believes a higher court will provide a more favorable outcome. This can include individuals, groups, or organizations, provided they have standing in the original case.",
            "prosecutor": "The 'prosecutor' in an 'Appeal' event is the legal representative who argues against the appeal, typically representing the state or the original decision. The prosecutor's role is to defend the original decision and argue why it should be upheld. In some cases, the prosecutor may also file an appeal if dissatisfied with the original decision.",
            "defendant": "The 'defendant' in an 'Appeal' event is the party against whom the appeal is filed. Typically, the defendant won the original case and must now defend that decision in a higher court. The defendant can be an individual or an organization and must respond to the appeal by providing arguments to support the original decision.",
            "place": "The 'place' in an 'Appeal' event refers to the location where the appeal is filed or heard. This can be a specific court, city, or country where the higher court is located. The place determines the jurisdiction of the higher court and is distinct from the 'Adjudicator', which is the authority reviewing the case."
