    "Attack(ConflictEvent)": {
        "description": "An 'Attack' event, a subtype of 'ConflictEvent', involves an aggressive action aimed at causing harm or damage to a target. It is characterized by the presence of an attacker, a target, and often an instrument used to carry out the attack. The scope includes physical, verbal, and cyber attacks. Unlike 'Demonstrate' events, which involve peaceful or non-violent gatherings, 'Attack' events are marked by violence or the intent to cause harm. Triggers for 'Attack' events often imply direct confrontation or harm, such as 'ambush' or 'bombardment'. Outcomes typically include injury, damage, or death, distinguishing them from other conflict events where the primary outcome may be protest or demonstration without direct harm.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "target": "The 'target' is the entity or entities that the attack is directed against. It can be individuals, groups, objects, or locations. The target is crucial for understanding the focus and intended harm of the attack. In some cases, the target may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context.",
            "victim": "The 'victim' is the entity that suffers harm or damage as a result of the attack. Victims can be individuals or groups and may overlap with the target, especially when the attack is directed at people. The victim is essential for understanding the human impact and severity of the event. In some cases, the victim may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context.",
            "attacker": "The 'attacker' is the entity that initiates and carries out the attack. Attackers can be individuals, groups, or organizations responsible for the aggressive action. The attacker is crucial for identifying the source of the aggression and understanding the dynamics of the conflict. In some cases, the attacker may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context.",
            "time": "The 'time' argument specifies when the attack took place, providing temporal context for the event. It can be a specific date, time of day, or a broader time frame. The time is important for situating the event within a timeline and understanding its sequence relative to other events. In some cases, the time may be implied rather than explicitly stated.",
            "instrument": "The 'instrument' is the tool or means used to carry out the attack. Instruments can be weapons, tools, or other means that facilitate the attack. The instrument is crucial for understanding the method and severity of the attack. In some cases, the instrument may be implied rather than explicitly stated.",
            "place": "The 'place' is the location where the attack occurs. It can be a specific location, city, or broader region. The place is important for situating the event geographically and understanding its spatial context. In some cases, the place may be implied rather than explicitly stated.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' is the entity responsible for initiating the attack. Agents can be individuals, groups, or organizations that plan and execute the attack. The agent is crucial for identifying the source of the aggression and understanding the dynamics of the conflict. In some cases, the agent may overlap with the attacker or may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context."
