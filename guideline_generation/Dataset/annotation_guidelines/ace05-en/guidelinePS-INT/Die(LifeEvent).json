    "Die(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Die' event type, a subclass of 'LifeEvent', refers to the cessation of life of one or more individuals due to various causes such as violence, accidents, or natural causes. It is characterized by the presence of a victim and often an agent or instrument causing the death. Unlike the 'Injure' event type, which involves harm but not necessarily death, the 'Die' event type specifically denotes the end of life. Example triggers include 'killed', 'died', 'fallen', and 'dead'. This event type can occur in contexts such as warfare, accidents, and natural disasters, and is distinguished from other 'LifeEvent' types like 'divorce', 'birth', and 'marry', which involve significant life changes but not the end of life.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "time": "The 'time' argument specifies when the death occurred, providing temporal context. It can be explicit (e.g., 'Monday' in 'were killed Monday') or inferred from context (e.g., 'died' in 'died, another case'). It includes relative expressions like 'yesterday' or 'recently' and may require contextual interpretation for ambiguous references (e.g., 'fallen comrades').",
            "place": "The 'place' argument identifies the location where the death occurred, offering spatial context. It can be specific (e.g., 'hotel' in 'At a nearby hotel, two other journalists...died') or broader (e.g., 'south Baghdad'). Sometimes, the place is inferred from context (e.g., 'center' in 'operation center').",
            "instrument": "The 'instrument' argument specifies the means or tool used to cause the death, highlighting the method. It can be explicit (e.g., 'missile' in 'hit by a missile') or inferred (e.g., 'operation center' implies military equipment). It includes weapons, objects, natural causes, or environmental factors.",
            "victim": "The 'victim' argument identifies the individual(s) who died, a central component of the 'Die' event type. It can be specific individuals (e.g., 'photographer' in 'a photographer from Reuters') or groups (e.g., 'civilians' in 'Five Iraqi civilians'). Sometimes, the victim is inferred from context (e.g., 'members' in 'all six British crew members').",
            "person": "The 'person' argument identifies individuals related to the event but not necessarily the victims, providing additional context. It includes witnesses, reporters, or indirectly affected individuals (e.g., 'family members' in 'family members mourned the loss'). Sometimes, the person is mentioned for context (e.g., 'reporter' in 'a reporter from the scene').",
            "agent": "The 'agent' argument identifies the entity responsible for causing the death, highlighting the perpetrator or cause. It can be explicit (e.g., 'coalition' in 'fired by the US-led coalition warplanes') or inferred (e.g., 'operation center' implies military actions). It includes groups, organizations, natural forces, or accidents."
