        "description": "A Divorce event, a subtype of LifeEvent, refers to the legal dissolution of a marriage between two individuals. It is characterized by the formal ending of a marital relationship, often involving legal proceedings and terms like 'irreconcilable differences'. Example triggers include 'divorce', 'filed for divorce', and 'sued for divorce'. Unlike the Marry event, which signifies the beginning of a marital relationship, the Divorce event marks its end and often involves legal actions, court proceedings, and legal settlements. Outcomes typically include the separation of the individuals involved and changes in marital status.",
