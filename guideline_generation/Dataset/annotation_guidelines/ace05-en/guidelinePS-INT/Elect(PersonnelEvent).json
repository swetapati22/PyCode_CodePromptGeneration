    "Elect(PersonnelEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Elect' event type, a subclass of 'PersonnelEvent', refers to the formal selection of an individual for a position or office through a voting mechanism. This event typically occurs within governmental or organizational contexts and involves a competitive process among multiple candidates. Unlike the 'Nominate' event, which proposes candidates, the 'Elect' event signifies the final decision and selection. Key characteristics include the involvement of a voting process, the presence of a selected individual (Person), and often a specific location (Place) or entity (Entity) associated with the election. Example triggers include 'elected', 'won', and 'winning'. Negative examples include 'becoming', which is a trigger for 'StartPosition', not 'Elect'.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "entity": "The 'entity' argument refers to the organization, body, or group that conducts the election or is associated with the elected position. It provides context about the scope and authority of the election, indicating the organizational framework within which the election occurs. Examples include 'USCF' in 'Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President' and 'Zambia' in 'Chiluba was Zambia's first democratically elected president'. The entity can sometimes be implicit or inferred from the context, especially in well-known elections.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument specifies the geographical location where the election takes place or where the elected position is relevant. It helps understand the regional or local context of the election, which can influence its significance and implications. Examples include 'Los Angeles' in 'Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President in Los Angeles' and 'Ohio' and 'Florida' in 'Kerry won decisively not only in Ohio and Florida'. The place can also refer to the jurisdiction or area of influence of the elected position.",
            "person": "The 'person' argument identifies the individual who is elected to the position. This argument is central to the event as it specifies the subject of the election. Examples include 'Beatriz Marinello' in 'Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President' and 'Douglas Wilder' in 'African Americans aren't just winning elected office, as former Gov. Douglas Wilder did'. The person can sometimes be referred to by their role or title, especially in formal contexts.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' argument refers to the entity or individual responsible for conducting the election or facilitating the process. This argument helps identify the authority or body overseeing the election, providing context about the legitimacy and procedural aspects of the event. Examples include 'pope' in 'the pope will reportedly name a new head of the troubled Boston archdiocese' and 'the government' in a state-run election. The agent might be an organization or a group rather than an individual."
