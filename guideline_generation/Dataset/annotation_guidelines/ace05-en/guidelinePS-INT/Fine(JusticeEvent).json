    "Fine(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "A Fine event involves the imposition of a monetary penalty on an entity by an adjudicator due to a legal or regulatory violation. This event is characterized by the presence of an adjudicator who imposes the fine and an entity that is required to pay it. Unlike other JusticeEvent types such as Convict or Acquit, the Fine event specifically involves a financial penalty rather than a determination of guilt or innocence. Example triggers include 'fine', 'fines', 'pay a fine', and 'slapped fines'. The outcome is the payment of a specified amount of money by the entity to the adjudicator or a designated authority, distinguishing it from events like Appeal, which involve a request for a review of a decision.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the authority or individual who imposes the fine, such as a judge, regulatory body, or any official entity with the power to levy fines. Examples include 'the judge ordered a fine' and 'the SEC fined the company'. The adjudicator must have legal or regulatory authority to impose fines, and in some cases, may be a collective body like a court or regulatory commission. Edge cases include situations where the adjudicator is implied rather than explicitly stated.",
            "entity": "The entity is the individual, organization, or group required to pay the fine. This can be a person, a company, or any other legal entity. Examples include 'the company was fined' and 'Ranjha was ordered to pay a fine'. The entity is responsible for the payment and can vary widely, from individuals to large corporations. Edge cases may include situations where the entity is part of a larger group or organization.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the fine is imposed or where the entity is required to pay the fine. This can be a city, country, or specific venue. Examples include 'fined in Los Angeles' and 'the fine was imposed in the company's offices'. Places can be specific or general, ranging from exact addresses to broader regions. Edge cases may include virtual or non-physical locations, such as online platforms where fines are imposed."
