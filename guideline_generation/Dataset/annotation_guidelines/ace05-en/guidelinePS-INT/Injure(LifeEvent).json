        "description": "The 'Injure' event type, a subclass of 'LifeEvent', refers to incidents where individuals sustain non-fatal physical harm or damage due to an external action or event. Key characteristics include the presence of a victim and often an agent or instrument causing the injury. Triggers such as 'injured', 'wounded', and 'hurting' are indicative of this event type. The scope includes various forms of physical harm, whether accidental or intentional, and can involve multiple victims and agents. It does not cover events where the primary outcome is death or other life events like birth or marriage.",
