    "ReleaseParole(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The ReleaseParole event involves the conditional release of a person from detention or imprisonment before the completion of their sentence, typically under specific conditions or supervision. This event is characterized by the involvement of a decision-making authority (e.g., parole boards, judges), the person being released, and the conditions under which the release is granted. Unlike the Pardon event, ReleaseParole does not imply forgiveness of the crime but rather a conditional freedom within the same jurisdiction. Example triggers include 'release' and 'parole'. Negative examples such as 'extradition' and 'pardon' help clarify that ReleaseParole is specifically about conditional release rather than transfer or forgiveness.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "entity": "The 'entity' argument refers to the organization or authority responsible for making the parole decision, such as a parole board, judge, or similar institution. Entities are distinct from agents in that they are the decision-making bodies rather than individuals carrying out the release. Examples include 'parole board' in 'the parole board decided to release him' and 'judge' in 'the judge released the prisoner'.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument specifies the location where the person is being released from or to. This can be a specific facility, such as 'detention center' in 'he was released from the detention center', or a broader geographical location, such as 'Maryland' in 'he was released in Maryland'. Unlike the Extradite event, where 'place' might refer to origin and destination, in ReleaseParole, it typically refers to the location of release.",
            "person": "The 'person' argument identifies the individual being released on parole. This can be a specific name or a pronoun, such as 'him' in 'the judge released him' or 'Michael' in 'Michael was released'. Unlike the Pardon event, where the person is forgiven for their crime, in ReleaseParole, the person is conditionally released.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' argument refers to the individual or group facilitating the release, such as a negotiator, lawyer, or another intermediary. Agents play a supportive role, often working on behalf of the person being released. Examples include 'negotiators' in 'the negotiators secured his release' and 'lawyer' in 'the lawyer got him released'. The agent is distinct from the entity in that the agent acts on behalf of the person, while the entity makes the decision."
