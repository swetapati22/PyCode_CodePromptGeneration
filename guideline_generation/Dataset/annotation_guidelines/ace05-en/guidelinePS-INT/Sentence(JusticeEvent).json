    "Sentence(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "A 'Sentence' event in the context of JusticeEvent refers to the formal declaration of punishment decided by a legal authority for a defendant found guilty of a crime. This event involves an adjudicator (e.g., court, judge), a defendant, and often a specific place where the sentencing occurs. Triggers include terms like 'sentenced', 'sentence', and 'handed out sentences'. The outcome can range from fines to imprisonment or even death, distinguishing it from events like 'Execute' (carrying out a death penalty) and 'Pardon' (forgiveness of punishment). For example, 'The court sentenced him to life imprisonment' is a 'Sentence' event, whereas 'He was executed' is an 'Execute' event, and 'He was pardoned by the president' is a 'Pardon' event.",

            "adjudicator": "The 'adjudicator' in a 'Sentence' event refers to the legal authority or body that issues the sentence, such as a court, judge, or official legal entity. For example, in 'The court sentenced him to five years', 'court' is the adjudicator. The adjudicator represents the authority behind the sentencing decision and may sometimes be implied rather than explicitly stated. Unlike the 'Prosecutor' in a 'ChargeIndict' event, the adjudicator decides the punishment. Edge cases include situations with multiple adjudicators, such as a panel of judges.",
            "place": "The 'place' in a 'Sentence' event refers to the location where the sentencing occurs, such as a specific court, city, or country. For example, in 'The New York court sentenced him to five years', 'New York' is the place. The place provides context and jurisdiction for the sentencing event and may sometimes be broader, such as a country or region. Unlike the 'Place' in an 'Execute' event, which refers to where the execution occurs, the 'place' in a 'Sentence' event is where the sentencing decision is made. Edge cases include virtual or remote sentencing.",
            "defendant": "The 'defendant' in a 'Sentence' event refers to the individual or individuals being sentenced. For example, in 'The court sentenced John to five years', 'John' is the defendant. The defendant is the central figure in the sentencing event, receiving the punishment. There may be multiple defendants in some cases. Unlike the 'Plaintiff' in an 'Appeal' event, who seeks a review of a decision, the defendant is the one being punished. Edge cases include situations where the defendant is a minor or has special circumstances."
