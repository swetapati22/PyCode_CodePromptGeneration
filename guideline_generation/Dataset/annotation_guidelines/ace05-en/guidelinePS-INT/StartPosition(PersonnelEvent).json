    "StartPosition(PersonnelEvent)": {
        "description": "The StartPosition event type refers to the commencement of a role or position by an individual or group within an organization or location. This event is characterized by a person or entity beginning a new job, role, or position. Triggers for this event include verbs such as 'becoming', 'return', 'replace', 'head', and 'was'. Unlike the Elect event, which involves a formal selection process, the StartPosition event focuses on the actual commencement of the role. It is distinct from the EndPosition event, which marks the conclusion of a role. The focus of StartPosition is on the beginning of a new role, not the end of an old one.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "time": "The 'time' argument specifies when the person or entity starts their new position, including specific dates, months, years, or relative time expressions. For example, 'January 2021' in 'He started his new role in January 2021'. This argument is crucial for understanding the temporal context of the event. In cases where the time is not explicitly mentioned, it can sometimes be inferred from the context. Edge cases include vague references like 'soon' or 'immediately'.",
            "entity": "The 'entity' argument refers to the organization, company, or group where the person is starting their new position. For example, 'TechCorp' in 'He became the CEO of TechCorp'. This argument provides context about the organization or group associated with the new role. In some cases, the entity may be a broader category, such as 'government' or 'university'. Edge cases include situations where the entity is implied but not explicitly stated.",
            "position": "The 'position' argument specifies the role or job title that the person or entity is starting. For example, 'marketing director' in 'She was appointed as the new marketing director'. This argument is essential for understanding the specific role or responsibilities associated with the event. In some cases, the position may be described in more general terms, such as 'leader' or 'manager'. Edge cases include roles that are not formally titled but are understood from context.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument indicates the location where the person or entity is starting their new position. For example, 'New York' in 'He started his new job in New York'. This argument provides geographical context for the event. In some cases, the place may be a specific building or office, such as 'headquarters'. Edge cases include virtual or remote positions where the physical location is less relevant.",
            "person": "The 'person' argument refers to the individual or group of individuals starting the new position. For example, 'John' in 'John became the new CEO'. This argument is crucial for identifying who is involved in the event. In some cases, the person may be a group or collective, such as 'the board members'. Edge cases include situations where the person is implied but not explicitly mentioned."
