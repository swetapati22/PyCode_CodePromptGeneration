    "Sue(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Sue' event type, a subclass of 'JusticeEvent', involves a legal action where one party (the plaintiff) initiates a lawsuit against another party (the defendant) in a court of law. This event is characterized by the formal process of bringing a legal claim to court, typically overseen by an adjudicator such as a judge. Unlike 'ChargeIndict', which involves formal accusations by a prosecutor, 'Sue' focuses on civil disputes initiated by private parties. Key elements include the presence of a plaintiff and a defendant, and often a specific place where the lawsuit is filed. Triggers for this event type include terms like 'lawsuit' and 'sued'. The outcome usually involves a legal judgment or settlement, distinguishing it from events like 'Execute' or 'Fine'.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The 'adjudicator' in a 'Sue' event is the individual or body responsible for overseeing the legal proceedings, such as a judge or a court. The adjudicator ensures the legal process is followed and makes rulings on the case. Examples include 'the judge' in 'the settlement approved by the judge' or 'the Supreme Court' in 'the case was heard in the Supreme Court'. The adjudicator's decisions can significantly impact the outcome, such as approving settlements or dismissing cases. In some instances, the adjudicator may be implied, as in 'the lawsuit was filed in federal court'.",
            "plaintiff": "The 'plaintiff' in a 'Sue' event is the party that initiates the lawsuit, seeking legal remedy for a grievance. The plaintiff actively pursues the legal action, unlike the defendant who responds to the lawsuit. Examples include individuals, groups, or organizations, such as 'the shareholders' in 'the shareholders sued the company' or 'the victims' families' in 'the victims' families filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer'. Multiple plaintiffs may be involved, as in 'the employees and their union sued the corporation'. Sometimes, the plaintiff is implied, as in 'a class action lawsuit was filed'.",
            "defendant": "The 'defendant' in a 'Sue' event is the party against whom the lawsuit is filed. The defendant responds to the allegations made by the plaintiff, often defending against the claims. Examples include individuals, companies, or entities, such as 'the company' in 'the company was sued by its employees' or 'the government' in 'the government was sued by the citizens'. Multiple defendants may be involved, as in 'the lawsuit named several executives and the corporation as defendants'. Sometimes, the defendant is implied, as in 'a lawsuit was filed against the organization'.",
            "place": "The 'place' in a 'Sue' event refers to the location where the lawsuit is filed or the court proceedings take place. The place determines the jurisdiction and legal framework under which the case is heard. Examples include cities, states, or specific courts, such as 'Washington' in 'the lawsuit was filed in Washington' or 'New York Supreme Court' in 'the case was heard in New York Supreme Court'. Sometimes, the place is broader, as in 'the lawsuit was filed in federal court'. In some cases, the place is implied, as in 'the lawsuit was filed'."
