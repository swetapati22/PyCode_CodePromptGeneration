    "TransferMoney(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": "The TransferMoney event involves the movement of money from one entity (the giver) to another (the recipient). This event is characterized by a financial transaction where the giver transfers a specified amount of money to the recipient, often with a specific purpose or beneficiary in mind. Triggers for this event include verbs such as 'give', 'pay', 'send', 'transfer', and 'donate'. Unlike the TransferOwnership event, which involves the transfer of ownership of physical or intangible assets, the TransferMoney event specifically deals with the transfer of monetary value. The scope includes personal transactions, business payments, donations, and financial settlements. Negative examples include actions that do not involve the transfer of money, such as 'providing services' or 'transferring ownership of property'.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "giver": "The giver is the entity that initiates the transfer of money, which can be an individual, organization, or any other entity providing the funds. Examples include 'Planned Parenthood' in 'Planned Parenthood gives money to Democrats' and 'girls' in 'The girls paid $900'. Multiple entities can also be givers, such as 'doctors, insurers, chains, HMOs, and chains' in 'doctors, insurers, chains, HMOs, and chains have poured money into members of Congress' coffers'. The giver can be abstract, like an organization or government body, and may sometimes be inferred from context.",
            "recipient": "The recipient is the entity that receives the money, which can be an individual, organization, or any other entity benefiting from the transfer. Examples include 'Democrats' in 'Planned Parenthood gives money to Democrats' and 'neighbor' in 'The girls paid $900 to the neighbor'. The recipient can be inferred from context if not explicitly mentioned and can also be an abstract entity or a group of entities.",
            "money": "The money argument specifies the amount of money being transferred, which can be a specific monetary value or a general reference to funds. Examples include 'a lot of money' in 'Planned Parenthood gives a lot of money to Democrats' and '$900' in 'The girls paid $900'. It can also include currency types and may be implied rather than explicitly stated.",
            "time": "The time argument specifies when the transfer of money takes place, which can be a specific date, time, or a general time frame. Examples include 'last week' in 'The girls paid $900 last week' and 'a month' in 'The Palestinian Authority sent Suha $200,000 a month'. It can also refer to recurring payments or be part of a larger temporal context.",
            "beneficiary": "The beneficiary is the entity that ultimately benefits from the transfer of money, which can be different from the recipient if the money is intended for a specific purpose. Examples include 'Democrats' in 'Planned Parenthood gives money to Democrats' and 'neighbor' in 'The girls paid $900 for the neighbor's distress'. The beneficiary can be implied, abstract, or a group of entities.",
            "place": "The place argument specifies the location where the transfer of money takes place, which can be a specific location or a general area.
