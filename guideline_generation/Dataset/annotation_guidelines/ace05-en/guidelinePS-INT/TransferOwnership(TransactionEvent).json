    "TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": "TransferOwnership events involve the transfer of ownership of an item or asset from one entity to another. These events are characterized by the presence of a giver (or seller), a recipient (or buyer), and the item or asset being transferred. Example triggers include 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', 'provide', and 'export'. Unlike TransferMoney events, which focus on the transfer of monetary funds, TransferOwnership events specifically involve tangible or intangible assets. The outcome is a change in ownership of the specified asset, distinguishing it from other transaction events where the primary focus might be on the exchange of services or monetary funds without a change in ownership of a specific item. Triggers such as 'donate' or 'gift' may indicate a TransferOwnership event if they involve the transfer of an asset, but if the focus is on the monetary value being transferred, it would be a TransferMoney event.",
