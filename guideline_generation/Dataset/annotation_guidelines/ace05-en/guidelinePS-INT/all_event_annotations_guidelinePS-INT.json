  "Acquit(JusticeEvent)": {
    "description": "The 'Acquit' event type, a subclass of 'JusticeEvent', refers to the formal legal process where a defendant is declared not guilty of the charges against them.

Key characteristics include the involvement of a legal adjudicator and the defendant being the subject of the acquittal. Example triggers include 'acquitted', 'found not guilty', and 'walk free'.

The adjudicator is essential for the legitimacy of the acquittal and can sometimes involve multiple adjudicators, such as a panel of judges.",
      "place": "The 'place' argument specifies the location where the acquittal occurs, such as a courtroom, city, or country. For example, 'The defendant was acquitted in New York' identifies 'New York' as the place.

This event involves a plaintiff who is dissatisfied with the original court's decision and seeks a review from a higher authority. Key characteristics include the involvement of a higher court (adjudicator) and the original decision being contested. Unlike initiating a legal action ('Sue'), an 'Appeal' is a continuation of an existing legal process. The outcome can result in the original decision being upheld, reversed, or modified, distinguishing it from events like 'Pardon' or 'ReleaseParole', which involve clemency or conditional release rather than judicial review. Example triggers include 'appeal', 'appealed', and 'appealing'.",

      "plaintiff": "The 'plaintiff' in an 'Appeal' event is the individual or entity that initiates the appeal, seeking a review of the original court's decision.

This can include individuals, groups, or organizations, provided they have standing in the original case.",
      "prosecutor": "The 'prosecutor' in an 'Appeal' event is the legal representative who argues against the appeal, typically representing the state or the original decision.

Unlike the Extradite event, which involves transferring a person between jurisdictions, ArrestJail focuses on the initial detention. The outcome is the individual's loss of freedom and potential legal proceedings, distinguishing it from events like Acquit, where the individual is declared not guilty and released.

This event is characterized by the involvement of a decision-making authority (e.g., parole boards, judges), the person being released, and the conditions under which the release is granted. Unlike the Pardon event, ReleaseParole does not imply forgiveness of the crime but rather a conditional freedom within the same jurisdiction. Example triggers include 'release' and 'parole'.

The outcome can range from fines to imprisonment or even death, distinguishing it from events like 'Execute' (carrying out a death penalty) and 'Pardon' (forgiveness of punishment).

  "Transport(MovementEvent)": {
    "description": "The Transport event type, a subclass of MovementEvent, involves the movement of entities (people, objects, etc.) from one location to another, facilitated by an agent or vehicle. It includes specific origin and destination locations, with example triggers such as 'transport', 'deploying', 'cross', 'tours', and 'back'. The event focuses on the conveyance of entities with a clear start and end point, distinguishing it from events like 'Evacuation' or 'Migration'. The outcome is the successful relocation of the entities involved.",
    "attributes": {
      "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
      "origin": "The origin argument specifies the starting point of the transport event. It can be a specific location, a broader region, or a conceptual starting point. For example, 'southern Sudan' in 'trains running to and from southern Sudan' is the origin. Context clues can help infer the origin if not explicitly mentioned.",
      "victim": "The victim argument refers to the entity being transported, often a person or group of people. For example, 'abducted women and children' in 'trains running to and from southern Sudan' are the victims. The victim can be an individual or a group and is distinct from the agent or vehicle.",

For example, 'trains' in 'trains running to and from southern Sudan' are the vehicles. The vehicle is the means by which the transport occurs, not the entity facilitating it.",
      "time": "The time argument specifies when the transport event occurs, including specific dates, durations, or relative time expressions. For example, 'In last year's trial' provides a temporal context. Time can be explicitly stated or inferred from context.",

Artifacts can be tangible objects or abstract entities and may be implied rather than explicitly stated.",
      "destination": "The destination argument specifies the endpoint of the transport event. It can be a specific location, a broader region, or a conceptual endpoint. For example, 'Sudan' in 'trains running to and from southern Sudan' is the destination. The destination is where the movement ends.",
      "place": "The place argument specifies the general location where the transport event occurs. It can be a specific location, a broader region, or a conceptual area. For example, 'Iraq' in 'getting back into Iraq' is the place. The place provides a general context rather than a specific start or end point.",
      "agent": "The agent argument refers to the entity facilitating the transport event. It can be individuals, groups, organizations, or abstract entities. For example, 'U.S. forces' in 'assisted by U.S. forces in getting back into Iraq' are the agents. The agent is the entity facilitating the movement, not the means by which it occurs."

  "TrialHearing(JusticeEvent)": {
    "description": "A TrialHearing event involves a formal judicial examination of evidence and arguments to determine the guilt or innocence of a defendant.
