            "An 'Attack' event, a subtype of 'ConflictEvent', involves an aggressive action aimed at causing harm or damage to a target. Example triggers include 'ambush', 'bombardment', 'take out', 'clashing', and 'raping and drugging'.",
            "The 'Attack' event is characterized by the presence of an attacker, a target, and often an instrument used to carry out the attack. The scope includes physical, verbal, and cyber attacks.",
            "Unlike 'Demonstrate' events, which involve peaceful or non-violent gatherings, 'Attack' events are marked by violence or the intent to cause harm. For instance, 'gathered' is a trigger for 'Demonstrate', not 'Attack'.",
            "Triggers for 'Attack' events often imply direct confrontation or harm, such as 'ambush' or 'bombardment', whereas 'Demonstrate' events use triggers like 'gathered' that do not imply violence.",
            "Outcomes of 'Attack' events typically include injury, damage, or death, distinguishing them from other conflict events where the primary outcome may be protest or demonstration without direct harm."
