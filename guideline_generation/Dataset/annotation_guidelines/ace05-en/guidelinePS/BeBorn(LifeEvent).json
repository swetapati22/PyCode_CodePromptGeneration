        "description": [
            "The 'BeBorn' event type, a subclass of 'LifeEvent', refers to the occurrence of a person's birth. Example triggers include 'birth', 'born', and 'having'.",
            "This event captures the moment when a new individual comes into existence. Key characteristics include the presence of a person being born, the location of the birth, and the time it occurred.",
            "Unlike the 'Die' event type, which marks the end of life, the 'BeBorn' event signifies the beginning of life. For instance, 'killed' is a trigger for 'Die', not 'BeBorn'.",
            "Triggers such as 'birth' and 'born' are indicative of the 'BeBorn' event type, whereas triggers like 'marry' or 'divorce' are related to other life events such as 'Marry' or 'Divorce'.",
            "The 'BeBorn' event is distinct from other life events like 'Injure' or 'Marry' as it specifically deals with the birth of a person, not injuries or marital status changes."

        "place": [
            "The 'place' argument specifies the location where the birth occurred. It is crucial for contextualizing the event. For example, 'home' in 'gave birth at her parents' home'.",
            "This argument can refer to any geographical location, such as a country, city, or specific building. For instance, 'New Zealand' in 'New Zealand-born Hunter'.",
            "In some cases, the place might be a general area rather than a specific location, like 'hospital' in 'gave birth at a Los Angeles-area hospital'.",
            "The 'place' argument helps in understanding the environment and circumstances of the birth. For example, 'nation' in 'the blood red nation of China'.",
            "Edge cases include ambiguous or broad locations that still provide context, such as 'home' or 'hospital'. These should be annotated as they contribute to the event's setting."
        ],
        "person": [
            "The 'person' argument identifies the individual(s) being born. This is the central focus of the 'BeBorn' event. For example, 'babies' in 'gave birth to both babies'.",
            "This argument can refer to a single person or multiple individuals, such as 'girls' and 'boys' in 'only about 100 girls are born for every 119 boys'.",
            "In some instances, the person might be referred to indirectly, like 'child' in 'gave birth to the couple's third child'.",
            "The 'person' argument is essential for specifying who is being born, providing clarity on the event's subject. For example, 'Hunter' in 'New Zealand-born Hunter'.",
            "Edge cases include references to the person by their relationship or role, such as 'one' and 'other' in 'one of unknown sex and the other, a fullterm girl'. These should still be annotated as they indicate the individuals being born."
        ],
        "time": [
            "The 'time' argument specifies when the birth occurred. It provides temporal context to the event. For example, 'January 14' in 'a fullterm girl, January 14'.",
            "This argument can refer to specific dates, times, or broader time frames, such as 'April 2001' in 'one of unknown sex in April 2001'.",
            "In some cases, the time might be mentioned in relation to other events or periods, like '1:52 a.m.' in 'gave birth to the couple's third child at 1:52 a.m.'.",
            "The 'time' argument helps in situating the birth event within a chronological framework, providing a clearer understanding of when it happened.",
            "Edge cases include vague or relative time references that still provide temporal context, such as '20-year-old policy' in 'curb the effects of a devastating 20-year-old policy'. These should be annotated as they contribute to the event's timing."
