            "A Convict event involves a formal declaration by an adjudicator that a defendant is guilty of a criminal offense. Example triggers include 'convicted', 'found guilty', and 'conviction'.",
            "This event type is characterized by the presence of a legal authority (adjudicator) who makes the judgment, a defendant who is being judged, and a place where the judgment occurs.",
            "Unlike the Sentence event, which focuses on the punishment given to a defendant, the Convict event focuses on the determination of guilt. For example, 'sentenced to five years' is indicative of a Sentence event, not a Convict event.",
            "Triggers such as 'extradition' or 'arrested' are indicative of Extradite and ArrestJail events, respectively, and not Convict events. The Convict event specifically involves the legal determination of guilt.",
            "The outcome of a Convict event is the formal recognition of the defendant's guilt, which may lead to subsequent events like sentencing. For instance, 'convicted of fraud' indicates a Convict event, while 'sentenced to prison' indicates a Sentence event."

        "adjudicator": [
            "The adjudicator is the legal authority or body that declares the defendant guilty. This can be a judge, jury, or court. For example, in 'The jury convicted him of theft', the jury is the adjudicator.",
            "The role of the adjudicator is crucial as they are responsible for the legal judgment. In 'Judge Smith found her guilty', Judge Smith is the adjudicator.",
            "In some cases, the adjudicator may be a collective body, such as a panel of judges or a jury. For instance, 'The panel of judges convicted the defendant' involves a collective adjudicator.",
            "The adjudicator must be a recognized legal authority. Unlike a witness or prosecutor, the adjudicator has the power to make a legal judgment. For example, 'The prosecutor accused him' does not indicate an adjudicator.",
            "Edge cases may involve non-traditional adjudicators, such as a tribunal or a special commission. For example, 'The tribunal found the defendant guilty' involves a tribunal as the adjudicator."
        ],
        "place": [
            "The place refers to the location where the conviction occurs. This can be a city, court, or country. For example, in 'He was convicted in New York', New York is the place.",
            "The place is important as it provides context for the legal jurisdiction. In 'The court in Los Angeles convicted her', Los Angeles is the place.",
            "In some cases, the place may be a specific building or institution, such as a courthouse. For instance, 'The conviction took place at the district court' involves a specific place.",
            "Unlike the origin or destination in an Extradite event, the place in a Convict event is where the legal judgment is made. For example, 'He was extradited from France' does not indicate a Convict event place.",
            "Edge cases may involve broader locations, such as a country or region. For example, 'He was convicted in the United States' involves a country as the place."
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "The defendant is the individual or entity being judged and found guilty. For example, in 'The court convicted John Doe', John Doe is the defendant.",
            "The role of the defendant is central to the Convict event as they are the subject of the legal judgment. In 'She was found guilty', 'she' is the defendant.",
            "In some cases, the defendant may be a group of individuals or an organization. For instance, 'The company was convicted of fraud' involves a company as the defendant.",
            "Unlike the person in an ArrestJail event, the defendant in a Convict event is specifically being judged for guilt. For example, 'The police arrested him' does not indicate a Convict event defendant.",
            "Edge cases may involve defendants who are not physically present, such as in absentia convictions. For example, 'He was convicted in absentia' involves a defendant who is not present."
