            "The DeclareBankruptcy event refers to a situation where an organization formally declares its inability to meet its financial obligations and seeks legal protection from creditors. Example triggers include 'bankruptcy', 'bankrupt', and 'file for bankruptcy'.",
            "This event type is characterized by the involvement of an organization (Org) that is undergoing financial distress and a legal process to manage its debts. Unlike other BusinessEvent types, DeclareBankruptcy specifically involves legal proceedings related to insolvency.",
            "Key characteristics of the DeclareBankruptcy event include the formal declaration of insolvency, legal proceedings, and the involvement of creditors. Triggers such as 'bankruptcy' and 'bankrupt' are indicative of this event type.",
            "Unlike the MergeOrg event, which involves the combination of two or more organizations, the DeclareBankruptcy event focuses on a single organization's financial failure. Triggers like 'merged' are not relevant to this event type.",
            "The outcomes of a DeclareBankruptcy event typically include legal protection from creditors, restructuring of debts, or liquidation of assets. This is distinct from the StartOrg event, which involves the creation of a new organization, and the EndOrg event, which involves the dissolution of an organization without the specific context of financial insolvency."

        "Org": [
            "The 'Org' argument refers to the organization that is declaring bankruptcy. This is a crucial element as it identifies the entity undergoing financial distress. For example, in the sentence 'worldcom once employed 80,000 people and went broke on the largest corporate bankruptcy in the united states,' 'worldcom' is the organization declaring bankruptcy.",
            "The 'Org' argument is important because it specifies the entity involved in the bankruptcy event. In the sentence 'Bankrupt energy giant Enron Corp is considering bringing legal action against its own bankers,' 'Enron Corp' is the organization in question.",
            "In the context of the DeclareBankruptcy event, the 'Org' argument helps to pinpoint the specific company or entity that is experiencing financial failure. For instance, 'united' in 'despite operating under bankruptcy laws, united posted the best on time performance' is the organization.",
            "The 'Org' argument can include various types of organizations, such as corporations, companies, or other business entities. For example, 'amr' in 'if they don't ratify these agreements, amr will have to file for bankruptcy' is the organization.",
            "Edge cases for the 'Org' argument might include situations where the organization is not explicitly named but can be inferred from context. For example, 'usairways is flying its way out of bankruptcy' clearly indicates 'usairways' as the organization."

        "Place": [
            "The 'Place' argument refers to the geographical location associated with the bankruptcy event. This can be the country, state, or city where the bankruptcy is declared. For example, in 'worldcom once employed 80,000 people and went broke on the largest corporate bankruptcy in the united states,' 'united states' is the place.",
            "The 'Place' argument is important as it provides context about the jurisdiction and legal environment in which the bankruptcy is taking place. For instance, 'united states' in the previous example indicates the location.",
            "In some cases, the 'Place' argument may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context. For example, if a well-known company based in a specific country declares bankruptcy, the place can be inferred.",
            "The 'Place' argument helps to understand the legal and economic environment surrounding the bankruptcy event. Different countries have different bankruptcy laws, which can affect the proceedings. For example, 'united states' in the context of 'worldcom' provides this information.",
            "Edge cases for the 'Place' argument might include situations where the location is not directly related to the legal proceedings but is mentioned in the context. For example, 'the largest corporate bankruptcy in the united states' clearly indicates 'united states' as the place."
