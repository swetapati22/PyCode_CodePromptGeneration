            "The 'Die' event type, a subclass of 'LifeEvent', refers to the cessation of life of one or more individuals. Example triggers include 'killed', 'died', 'fallen', and 'dead'.",
            "This event type captures scenarios where death occurs due to various causes, including violence, accidents, or natural causes. Key characteristics include the presence of a victim and often an agent or instrument causing the death.",
            "Unlike the 'Injure' event type, which involves harm but not necessarily death, the 'Die' event type specifically denotes the end of life. For instance, 'wounding' is indicative of 'Injure', not 'Die'.",
            "Triggers such as 'divorce', 'birth', and 'marry' are indicative of other 'LifeEvent' types and do not pertain to the 'Die' event type. These events involve significant life changes but not the end of life.",
            "The scope of the 'Die' event type includes various contexts such as warfare, accidents, and natural disasters. The outcome is always the death of the victim(s), distinguishing it from events where individuals survive or are merely injured."

            "In some cases, the exact time may not be explicitly mentioned but inferred from the context. Example: 'died' in 'died, another case' implies a recent event.",
            "The 'time' argument can also include relative time expressions such as 'yesterday', 'last week', or 'recently'. Example: 'recently killed' provides a temporal context.",

            "In some cases, the instrument may be a weapon or object used in the event. Example: 'explosives' in 'detonated explosives'.",
            "The 'instrument' argument can also include natural causes or environmental factors. Example: 'fire' in 'returning fire' implies the use of firearms.",
