            "The 'Nominate' event type refers to the act of officially suggesting or appointing a person for a position, role, or task. Example triggers include 'name', 'nominating', and 'designated'.",
            "This event type involves an agent (the nominator) who proposes a person (the nominee) for a specific role or task. The nomination can be formal or informal.",
            "Key characteristics of the 'Nominate' event include the presence of an agent making the nomination and a person being nominated. The event often implies a future role or responsibility for the nominee.",
            "Unlike the 'Elect' event type, which involves a selection process typically through voting, the 'Nominate' event focuses on the proposal or suggestion phase without necessarily involving a selection process.",
            "Triggers such as 'elected' or 'appointed' are indicative of 'Elect' or 'StartPosition' events, not 'Nominate'. The 'Nominate' event is specifically about the act of proposing or suggesting a candidate."
