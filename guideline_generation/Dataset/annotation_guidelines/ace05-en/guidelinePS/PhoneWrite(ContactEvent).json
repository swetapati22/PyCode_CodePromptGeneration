            "PhoneWrite is a subtype of ContactEvent that involves written or spoken communication through phone or written correspondence such as letters or emails.",
            "Triggers for PhoneWrite include words like 'correspondence', 'letters', 'spoke', 'calling', and 'sent'. These indicate an exchange of information between entities.",
            "Key characteristics of PhoneWrite include the presence of an entity initiating the communication, an entity receiving the communication, and often a place where the communication occurs.",
            "Unlike Meet events, which involve physical presence and face-to-face interaction, PhoneWrite events are characterized by remote communication, either through phone or written mediums.",
            "Triggers such as 'meeting' or 'talks' are indicative of Meet events, not PhoneWrite. PhoneWrite focuses on non-physical, remote exchanges of information."
