            "The StartPosition event type refers to the commencement of a role or position by an individual or group. This event is characterized by a person or entity beginning a new job, role, or position within an organization or location.",
            "Triggers for the StartPosition event include verbs such as 'becoming', 'return', 'replace', 'head', and 'was'. These triggers indicate the start of a new role or position.",
            "Key characteristics of the StartPosition event include the presence of a person or entity, the new position or role they are starting, and often the location or organization where this role is being undertaken.",
            "Unlike the Elect event, which involves a formal selection process, the StartPosition event focuses on the actual commencement of the role. For example, 'elected' is a trigger for Elect, not StartPosition.",
            "The StartPosition event is distinct from the EndPosition event, which marks the conclusion of a role. Triggers like 'former' indicate EndPosition, not StartPosition. The focus of StartPosition is on the beginning of a new role, not the end of an old one."
