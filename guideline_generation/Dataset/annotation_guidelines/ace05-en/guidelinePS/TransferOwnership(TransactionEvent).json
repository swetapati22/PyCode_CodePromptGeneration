            "TransferOwnership events involve the transfer of ownership of an item or asset from one entity to another. Example triggers include 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', 'provide', and 'export'.",
            "This event type is characterized by the presence of a giver (or seller), a recipient (or buyer), and the item or asset being transferred. The transaction may also include details such as time, place, and price.",
            "Unlike TransferMoney events, which focus on the transfer of monetary funds, TransferOwnership events specifically involve the transfer of tangible or intangible assets. For example, 'selling a car' is a TransferOwnership event, whereas 'transferring $100' is a TransferMoney event.",
            "Triggers such as 'donate' or 'gift' may indicate a TransferOwnership event if they involve the transfer of an asset. However, if the focus is on the monetary value being transferred, it would be a TransferMoney event.",
            "The outcome of a TransferOwnership event is the change in ownership of the specified asset. This differs from other transaction events where the primary focus might be on the exchange of services or monetary funds without a change in ownership of a specific item."
